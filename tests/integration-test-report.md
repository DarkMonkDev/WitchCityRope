# Integration Test Report
Date: July 23, 2025

## Summary

Our fixes have made significant improvements to public access, but the integration test suite is currently not fully operational due to compilation errors.

## Test Results

### 1. Public Access Tests (Manual Testing) ✅
Using curl to verify our authorization policy fixes:

| Route | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| `/` (Home) | 200 OK | 200 OK | ✅ PASS |
| `/events` | 200 OK | 200 OK | ✅ PASS |
| `/about` | 200 OK | 200 OK | ✅ PASS |
| `/contact` | 200 OK | 500 Error | ❌ FAIL |

**Public access is working for 3 out of 4 public routes.**

### 2. Authentication Tests (Manual Testing) ✅
Protected routes correctly redirect to login:

| Route | Expected | Actual | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| `/admin` | Redirect to Login | Redirected | ✅ PASS |
| `/admin/events` | Redirect to Login | Redirected | ✅ PASS |
| `/member` | Redirect to Login | Redirected | ✅ PASS |

**All protected routes are correctly secured.**

### 3. Static Resources ✅
- CSS bundle (`/WitchCityRope.Web.styles.css`): ✅ Accessible

### 4. Integration Test Suite Status ❌
The automated test suite has compilation errors preventing execution:
- **WitchCityRope.IntegrationTests**: Interface implementation issues with `IUser`
- **WitchCityRope.Api.Tests**: Various type mismatches and ambiguous references
- **Playwright Tests**: 14 failed, 7 passed (mostly due to authentication requirements)

## Comparison to Previous Results

**Previous Status**: 66 out of 142 tests passing overall

**Current Status**: 
- Manual verification shows our authorization fixes are working
- Public routes are now accessible without authentication (3/4 working)
- Protected routes correctly require authentication (3/3 working)
- Test suite itself needs fixes to compile and run properly

## Fixes That Are Working

1. ✅ **Anonymous Access Policy**: Public pages no longer require authentication
2. ✅ **Static File Access**: CSS and other static resources are accessible
3. ✅ **Authentication Redirects**: Protected routes properly redirect to login
4. ✅ **Authorization Policies**: Correctly applied to public vs protected areas

## Remaining Issues

1. **Contact Page Error** (500): The `/contact` page throws an internal server error
2. **Test Compilation**: Integration tests need updates to match current interfaces
3. **Missing Dependencies**: Some test projects missing APIMatic.Core package

## Recommendations

1. Fix the contact page 500 error
2. Update test projects to resolve compilation errors
3. Re-run full test suite once compilation issues are resolved
4. Focus on fixing the navigation link tests that were previously failing

## Conclusion

The authorization policy fixes have been successful. Public pages are now accessible without authentication, which was the primary issue. The test suite needs maintenance to properly validate these fixes, but manual testing confirms the core functionality is working as expected.
