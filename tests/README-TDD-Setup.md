### 2. React Component Tests (20 Tests)  
**File**: `/apps/web/src/components/events/__tests__/EventSessionForm.test.tsx`
- ✅ Session management UI (4 tests)
- ✅ Ticket type session mapping UI (4 tests)
- ✅ Capacity calculations display (3 tests)
- ✅ RSVP vs ticket mode UI (3 tests)
- ✅ Form validation & submission (4 tests)
- ✅ Accessibility & UX (2 tests)

### 3. Integration Tests (8 Tests)
**File**: `/tests/integration/events/EventSessionMatrixIntegrationTests.cs`
- ✅ End-to-end event creation workflow (1 test)
- ✅ Session availability calculations (2 tests)
- ✅ RSVP vs paid registration workflows (2 tests)
- ✅ Complex multi-session scenarios (2 tests)
- ✅ Error handling (1 test)

### 4. Test Infrastructure Support
- ✅ `/tests/WitchCityRope.Tests.Common/Builders/EventWithSessionsBuilder.cs`
- ✅ `/tests/WitchCityRope.Tests.Common/Builders/EventSessionBuilder.cs`
- ✅ `/tests/WitchCityRope.Tests.Common/Builders/TicketTypeBuilder.cs`
- ✅ `/tests/WitchCityRope.Tests.Common/Fixtures/DatabaseTestFixture.cs`
- ✅ `/tests/WitchCityRope.Tests.Common/Fixtures/DatabaseTestBase.cs`
- ✅ `/tests/WitchCityRope.Tests.Common/Fixtures/PostgreSqlIntegrationFixture.cs`

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ `/docs/functional-areas/events/new-work/2025-08-24-events-management/implementation/test-plan.md`
- ✅ Updated `/docs/standards-processes/testing/TEST_CATALOG.md`

## Core Architecture Tested

```
Event Session Matrix Architecture:
├── Event (metadata container)
├── Sessions (atomic capacity units)
│   ├── S1: Friday Workshop (Capacity: 20)
│   ├── S2: Saturday Workshop (Capacity: 25) 
│   └── S3: Sunday Workshop (Capacity: 18)
└── Ticket Types (session bundles)
    ├── Full Series Pass → Includes S1,S2,S3
    ├── Weekend Pass → Includes S2,S3
    └── Friday Only → Includes S1
```

## Key Business Rules Tested

1. **Sessions are atomic units of capacity** (not ticket types)
2. **Ticket availability limited by most constrained session**
3. **RSVP mode for social events** (no payment required)  
4. **Payment processing required for all class events** (even $0)
5. **Cross-session capacity tracking** for multi-session tickets

## Test Status

### ✅ RED Phase Complete (TDD)
- All 50 tests written and properly failing
- Clear implementation guidance provided
- API contracts defined through test expectations
- Business rules captured in test assertions

### ⏳ GREEN Phase (Next Steps)
Implementation needed to make tests pass:
1. Create Core Entities: `EventSession`, `TicketType`, `SessionInclusion`
2. Implement Capacity Calculations: Session-based availability logic
3. Build React Components: `EventSessionForm` with Mantine UI
4. Create API Endpoints: Event management with session matrix
5. Database Migrations: Add session tables and relationships

### ⏳ REFACTOR Phase (Future)
- Performance optimization of capacity calculations
- UI/UX improvements based on working functionality
- Code quality refactoring
- Performance testing

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Docker is running for TestContainers
sudo systemctl start docker

# Navigate to project directory
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope
```

### Backend API Tests
```bash
dotnet test tests/WitchCityRope.Api.Tests/Features/Events/EventSessionTests.cs
```

### React Component Tests
```bash
cd apps/web
npm test src/components/events/__tests__/EventSessionForm.test.tsx
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
dotnet test tests/integration/events/EventSessionMatrixIntegrationTests.cs
```

## Expected Test Results (RED Phase)

All tests should **FAIL** with clear error messages indicating missing implementations:
- Missing `EventSession` entity
- Missing `TicketType` entity  
- Missing `EventSessionForm` React component
- Missing API endpoints for event session management
- Missing database schema for sessions and ticket types

This is **EXACTLY CORRECT** for TDD Red phase!

## Benefits Achieved

- ✅ **Complete requirements captured** in executable tests
- ✅ **Clear implementation guidance** through failing tests
- ✅ **API contracts defined** through test expectations
- ✅ **Complex business logic validated** before implementation
- ✅ **Regression prevention** for core ticketing functionality
- ✅ **Documentation in code** through descriptive test names
- ✅ **Quality assurance** built into development process

## Next Phase: Implementation

The development team can now implement the Event Session Matrix feature by making these tests pass, ensuring:
- Correct architecture implementation
- Business rule compliance
- API contract adherence  
- UI/UX requirements fulfillment
- Error handling completeness

**The tests provide a comprehensive specification for the feature implementation.**
