# Dashboard Vetting Status Bug - Executive Summary
**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Issue**: Users seeing incorrect vetting application status on dashboard

---

## Problem

Users who have submitted vetting applications and are in "Under Review" status are seeing:
- ❌ "Ready to join our community?" message
- ❌ "Submit Vetting Application" button

Instead of:
- ✅ "Under Review" status badge
- ✅ "Your application is being reviewed..." message

---

## Root Cause (IDENTIFIED ✅)

**Location**: `/apps/api/Features/Dashboard/Services/UserDashboardService.cs`, Line 55

**Bug**:
```csharp
HasVettingApplication = user.VettingStatus > 0,
```

**Why It's Wrong**:
- `VettingStatus = 0` is "Under Review" (a VALID application status)
- Code checks `VettingStatus > 0` to determine if user has application
- Result: Users with `VettingStatus = 0` are treated as having NO application
- This is a classic off-by-one/boundary condition error

---

## Impact

### Affected Users
- ❌ member@witchcityrope.com (VettingStatus = 0, Under Review)
- ❌ guest@witchcityrope.com (VettingStatus = 0, Under Review)
- ✅ vetted@witchcityrope.com (VettingStatus = 4, Approved) - Working correctly

### User Experience Impact
1. User submits vetting application
2. Admin marks it "Under Review" (VettingStatus = 0)
3. User logs in and sees "Submit Application" button again
4. **User is confused**: "Did my application not submit?"
5. Risk of duplicate submissions

---

## Evidence Collected

### 1. Database Verification ✅
```sql
SELECT "Email", "VettingStatus", "IsVetted" FROM "Users"
WHERE "Email" IN ('member@witchcityrope.com', 'guest@witchcityrope.com')

Result:
- member@witchcityrope.com: VettingStatus = 0 (UnderReview)
- guest@witchcityrope.com: VettingStatus = 0 (UnderReview)
```

### 2. API Response Analysis ✅
Dashboard API returns:
```json
{
  "vettingStatus": "UnderReview",          // ✅ Correct
  "hasVettingApplication": false,          // ❌ WRONG!
}
```
**Contradiction**: Status says "UnderReview" but system claims no application exists.

### 3. Screenshots ✅
- `dashboard-member.png` - Shows "Submit Application" button (WRONG)
- `dashboard-guest.png` - Shows "Submit Application" button (WRONG)
- `dashboard-vetted.png` - Shows "Approved" badge (CORRECT)

### 4. Frontend Code Review ✅
Frontend logic is **CORRECT** - it displays based on `hasVettingApplication` from API.
Problem is entirely in the backend.

## Recommended Fix

### Option 1: Check Actual Application Table (BEST PRACTICE)

**File**: `/apps/api/Features/Dashboard/Services/UserDashboardService.cs`
**Change**: Line 55

**Before**:
```csharp
HasVettingApplication = user.VettingStatus > 0,
```

**After**:
```csharp
// Check if user has actual application record
var hasApplication = await _context.VettingApplications
    .AnyAsync(va => va.UserId == userId, cancellationToken);

// ... in UserDashboardResponse:
HasVettingApplication = hasApplication,
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Most accurate - checks actual data
- ✅ Handles all edge cases
- ✅ Resilient to future changes

**Cons**:
- Additional database query (minimal performance impact)

---

### Option 2: Include UnderReview Status (SIMPLE FIX)

**Before**:
```csharp
HasVettingApplication = user.VettingStatus > 0,
```

**After**:
```csharp
HasVettingApplication = user.VettingStatus >= 0,  // Include UnderReview (0)
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ One-line fix
- ✅ No additional queries
- ✅ Immediate solution

**Cons**:
- Assumes VettingStatus field accurately reflects application state
- Doesn't verify actual application record exists

---

## Testing Verification

After fix, verify:

### For member@witchcityrope.com (UnderReview):
- [ ] Dashboard shows "Under Review" badge
- [ ] Dashboard shows "Your application is being reviewed..." message
- [ ] Dashboard does NOT show "Submit Application" button
- [ ] API returns `hasVettingApplication: true`

### For guest@witchcityrope.com (UnderReview):
- [ ] Dashboard shows "Under Review" badge
- [ ] Dashboard does NOT show "Submit Application" button

### For vetted@witchcityrope.com (Approved):
- [ ] Dashboard continues to show "Approved" status (no regression)

### For new user (no vetting status):
- [ ] Dashboard shows "Submit Application" button
- [ ] API returns `hasVettingApplication: false`

## Files to Modify

### Required Change:
- `/apps/api/Features/Dashboard/Services/UserDashboardService.cs` (Line 55)

### Test File Available:
- `/apps/web/tests/playwright/debug-dashboard-vetting.spec.ts` - Use this to verify fix

## Severity & Priority

| Metric | Rating | Justification |
|--------|--------|---------------|
| **Severity** | HIGH | Blocks users from seeing application status |
| **Complexity** | LOW | Single line fix, clear root cause |
| **Risk** | LOW | Isolated change, frontend already correct |
| **Priority** | **HIGH** | User-facing issue, potential duplicate submissions |

---

## Next Steps

1. **backend-developer**: Implement fix in `UserDashboardService.cs`
2. **test-executor**: Run verification tests
3. **Verify with test users**: Login as member@ and guest@ to confirm fix
4. **Monitor**: Check for any regression with vetted@ user
