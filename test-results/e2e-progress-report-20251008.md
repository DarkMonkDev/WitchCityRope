## Failure Analysis

### Root Cause: WebSocket Connection Issues

**Primary Failure Pattern**: All 6 failing tests show the same error:
```
WebSocket connection to 'ws://localhost:24678/?token=...' failed:
Error in connection establishment: net::ERR_SOCKET_NOT_CONNECTED
```

**Impact**: This WebSocket error causes console errors which the tests are configured to fail on, even though the core functionality may be working.

### Secondary Issues

1. **401 Unauthorized Errors**
   - Pattern: `401 http://localhost:5655/api/auth/user`
   - Frequency: Multiple occurrences in all failing tests
   - Likely Cause: Authentication state not persisting correctly between requests

2. **Connection Reset Errors**
   - Pattern: `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET`
   - Related to port 24678 (likely Vite HMR websocket)
   - Not blocking core functionality but causing test failures

### Test Configuration Issue

The tests are configured to **fail on console errors**, which means infrastructure issues (WebSocket, 401s) cause tests to fail even when the actual user workflow might be functioning correctly.

## Launch-Critical Workflow Status

### ✅ Working Workflows (Verified)
1. **Admin Access Control** ✅
   - Admin can access event details
   - Admin authentication persists
   - Non-admin users are correctly blocked

2. **Unauthenticated Access Handling** ✅
   - Redirects work correctly
   - Login flow protection functioning

### ❌ Failing Workflows (Needs Investigation)
1. **Dashboard Access After Login** ❌
   - Login succeeds but dashboard load has errors
   - May be false failure due to console error checking

2. **Direct URL Navigation** ❌
   - Direct dashboard access failing console checks
   - Core redirect logic might be working

3. **Page Refresh Persistence** ❌
   - Dashboard refresh shows console errors
   - Authentication may not persist through refresh

## Comparison: Historical vs Current

### Test Suite Size
| Metric | Historical (Phase 0) | After Phase 1 | After Phase 2 | Current |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
| Total Tests | 268 | ~255* | ~250* | **10** |
| Test Files | ~84* | ~80* | ~75* | **2** |

*Estimated based on historical patterns

**CRITICAL**: A **96% reduction** in test coverage has occurred. This was likely intentional (focusing on critical paths) but represents a significant change in testing strategy.

### Pass Rates
| Baseline | Current | Change |
|----------|---------|--------|
| 169/268 (63.1%) | 4/10 (40%) | **-23.1%** |

**Note**: Direct comparison is not valid due to completely different test suites.

## Infrastructure vs Business Logic

### Infrastructure Status: ✅ 100% HEALTHY
- Docker containers operational
- API responding correctly
- Web service functional
- Database connected
- No compilation errors

### Business Logic Issues
The failures appear to be **test infrastructure problems** rather than business logic failures:

1. **WebSocket connectivity** - Vite HMR not connecting
2. **401 Unauthorized** - Auth token handling between requests
3. **Test error detection** - Too strict console error checking

## Categorization of Remaining Failures

### Timing/Flaky Issues (Estimated: 0)
No clear timing-based failures observed. All failures are consistent.

### Real Bugs to Fix (Estimated: 2-3)
1. **Authentication Persistence** (HIGH)
   - 401 errors suggest auth tokens not persisting
   - Affects: Dashboard access, refresh, direct URL

2. **WebSocket Connection** (MEDIUM)
   - Port 24678 not accepting connections
   - Likely Vite HMR configuration issue
   - Does not block core functionality

### Outdated/Invalid Tests (Estimated: 3)
1. **Overly Strict Console Error Checking**
   - Tests fail on infrastructure warnings
   - Should distinguish critical vs non-critical errors

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Before Launch)

1. **Fix Authentication Persistence** (CRITICAL)
   ```
   Priority: HIGH
   Agent: backend-developer
   Issue: 401 errors on /api/auth/user endpoint
   Investigation needed: Cookie/token handling
   ```

2. **Resolve WebSocket Connection** (MEDIUM)
   ```
   Priority: MEDIUM
   Agent: react-developer
   Issue: Vite HMR websocket on port 24678
   Investigation: Docker network configuration
   Note: Does not block core functionality
   ```

3. **Adjust Test Error Handling** (MEDIUM)
   ```
   Priority: MEDIUM
   Agent: test-developer
   Action: Differentiate critical vs non-critical console errors
   Allow: WebSocket warnings (development only)
   Fail on: Actual JS errors, API 500 errors
   ```

### Test Suite Strategy Decision Needed

**QUESTION FOR STAKEHOLDERS**: Should we:

**Option A**: Continue with focused 10-test suite?
- ✅ Faster execution (30 seconds)
- ✅ Focuses on critical paths
- ❌ Only 4% of original coverage

**Option B**: Restore broader test coverage?
- ✅ Comprehensive validation
- ❌ Longer execution time
- ❌ May include outdated tests

**Option C**: Incremental expansion?
- Start with 10 critical tests
- Add tests for each major feature
- Target: 50-75 tests covering key workflows

## Can We Stop at This Pass Rate?

### Current Reality Check

**Current Pass Rate**: 40% (4/10 tests)
**Target Pass Rate**: 90%+
**GAP**: **50 percentage points**

**Answer**: **NO, we cannot stop here.**

### Minimum Requirements for Launch

1. **Authentication Must Work 100%** ✅ (Partially Working)
   - ✅ Login flow functional
   - ❌ Persistence through refresh broken
   - ❌ Direct URL access not working

2. **Dashboard Access Must Work 100%** ❌ (Currently Failing)
   - ❌ Post-login dashboard load has errors
   - ❌ Direct URL navigation failing
   - ❌ Refresh not working

3. **Admin Features Must Work 100%** ⚠️ (Mixed Results)
   - ✅ Event details access working
   - ❌ Admin page load has console errors
   - ✅ Access control working

### Launch-Critical Status

| Workflow | Status | Blocker? |
|----------|--------|----------|
| User Login | ✅ Working | No |
| Dashboard Access | ❌ Failing | **YES** |
| Dashboard Refresh | ❌ Failing | **YES** |
| Admin Access | ⚠️ Partial | **YES** |
| Event Browsing | ✅ Working | No |
| Access Control | ✅ Working | No |

**VERDICT**: **3 LAUNCH BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED**

## Phase 3 Requirements

Based on this analysis, **Phase 3 is REQUIRED** with the following focus:

### Phase 3 Priority Tasks

1. **Fix Authentication Persistence** (CRITICAL)
   - Resolve 401 errors on authenticated endpoints
   - Ensure tokens/cookies persist through refresh
   - Enable direct URL navigation to protected pages

2. **Fix WebSocket Connection** (HIGH)
   - Configure Vite HMR for Docker environment
   - Or disable HMR in test environment
   - Prevent false test failures

3. **Adjust Test Error Detection** (HIGH)
   - Distinguish infrastructure warnings from critical errors
   - Allow WebSocket failures in development
   - Fail only on actual business logic errors

### Success Criteria for Phase 3

- ✅ All 10 tests passing (100%)
- ✅ No 401 errors on authenticated endpoints
- ✅ Dashboard accessible after login, refresh, and direct URL
- ✅ Admin pages load without console errors
- ✅ Tests run cleanly in Docker environment

### Timeline Estimate

- **Quick Wins** (2-4 hours):
  - Adjust test error filtering
  - WebSocket configuration fix

- **Core Fix** (4-8 hours):
  - Authentication persistence debugging
  - Cookie/token handling review

- **Total Phase 3**: 1-2 days

## Test Artifacts

**Log File**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/test-results/e2e-progress-after-phase2-20251007.log`
**Error Contexts**: `test-results/specs-*/error-context.md`

## Conclusion

**Current State**: The E2E test suite has been dramatically reduced to 10 critical-path tests. Of these, only 4 (40%) are passing due to infrastructure issues (WebSocket, authentication persistence) rather than business logic failures.

**Progress from Phase 2**: Unable to measure due to complete test suite change. The baseline of 268 tests no longer exists.

**Next Steps**: **Phase 3 is REQUIRED** to fix authentication persistence and WebSocket configuration. With these fixes, we estimate reaching **90-100% pass rate** on the focused 10-test suite.

**Launch Readiness**: **NOT READY** - 3 launch-critical blockers must be resolved.
