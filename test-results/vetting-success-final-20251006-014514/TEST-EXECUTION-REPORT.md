### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issue: Submit Button Still Visible
**Observed**: Dashboard still shows "SUBMIT VETTING APPLICATION" button

**Severity**: LOW - Does not block core functionality
**Impact**: User could potentially submit duplicate applications
**Recommendation**: Frontend developer should add conditional rendering to hide button when `vettingStatus !== 'not-started'`

## Conclusion

‚úÖ **TEST PASSED** - All critical success criteria met. The vetting application flow works end-to-end with the correct success screen displaying exactly 7 stages, no checkmark icon at the top, and no application number references.
