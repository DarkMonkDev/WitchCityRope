- Dashboard route structure: `/dashboard/events`
- Admin authentication scaffolding in place

### ‚ùå ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**Authentication Requirements**
- Admin routes may need authentication verification
- Test failures suggest loading states not properly implemented
- EventsPage component failing 9/14 tests due to loading state issues

**Route Implementation Issues**
- EventsPage tests fail to find progress bar role during loading
- CSS media query warnings in DashboardLayout component
- Navigation structure exists but UX may need refinement

---

## üìã PHASE 2: EVENT SESSION MATRIX BACKEND

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING

**CRUD Operations for Events**
- **GET /api/events**: ‚úÖ WORKING (Returns 4 sample events)
- Sample data includes:
  - Introduction to Rope Bondage (Class, $50)
  - Midnight Rope Performance (Performance, $25) 
  - Monthly Rope Social (Social, $15)
  - Advanced Suspension Techniques (Class, $100)

**Event Data Structure**
- Complete event objects with all required fields:
  - ID, title, slug, description, type
  - Start/end dates, location, capacity
  - Current/available attendees, pricing
  - Organizer information, vetting requirements

**Database Integration**
- PostgreSQL queries executing successfully (seen in logs)
- Event retrieval with organizer joins working
- Published events filtering operational

### ‚ùì PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED / UNKNOWN STATUS

**Session Management**
- Session endpoints not yet tested
- Event-to-session relationships unclear from current tests
- Multi-session event support status unknown

**Ticket Type Management**
- Backend structure suggests ticket types exist
- Integration with pricing tiers needs verification
- Advanced ticket configuration status unknown

## üìã PHASE 3: FRONTEND COMPONENTS

### ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED AND WORKING

**Event Card Display**
- EventsList component: ‚úÖ 8/8 unit tests passing
- Proper error handling for API failures
- Network timeout handling implemented
- Loading states and error messages functional

**Component Structure**
- EventsList component well-tested and functional
- Mantine UI integration working
- Mock service worker (MSW) properly configured for testing

### ‚ùå ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**Event Details Page**
- EventsPage component: ‚ùå 9/14 tests failing
- Loading state implementation issues (progressbar role missing)
- Mantine CSS media query warnings affecting test output
- Alert messages working but loading indicators not

**RSVP Modal Implementation**
- Status unknown - no RSVP-specific tests found
- RSVP endpoints not confirmed functional
- Modal component testing needs implementation

**Event Session Matrix Demo**
- E2E Tests: ‚ùå 8/12 failing (67% failure rate)
- UI component issues with strict mode violations
- Tab switching functionality partially broken
- TinyMCE editor integration issues

### üîç DETAILED E2E FAILURES ANALYSIS

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. **Strict Mode Violations**: Multiple elements matching selectors (e.g., 8 'S1' elements)
2. **Tab Navigation Broken**: Cannot find tabs with expected text patterns
3. **Form Submission Issues**: Loading states not appearing as expected
4. **Editor Integration Problems**: TinyMCE vs TipTap editor conflicts
5. **Timeout Issues**: 30-second timeouts on basic interactions

---

## üìã PHASE 4: REGISTRATION/RSVP FLOW

### ‚ùì STATUS UNKNOWN - NEEDS INVESTIGATION

**RSVP for Social Events (Free)**
- API endpoints for RSVP not confirmed accessible
- Frontend RSVP modal components not tested
- Social event type (type: 1) identified in API data
- Business logic for free RSVP needs verification

**Ticket Purchase for Classes (Paid)**
- Pricing structure exists in API (classes have $50-$100 prices)
- Payment integration status unknown
- Class event types (type: 0) identified in API data
- Purchase flow implementation status unclear

**Business Rule Enforcement**
- Event type differentiation working in backend
- Frontend enforcement of Social vs Class rules needs testing
- Capacity checking logic exists (currentAttendees/maxAttendees)
- Vetting requirements available but enforcement untested

---

## üìã PHASE 5: CHECK-IN SYSTEM

### ‚ùå NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

**Check-in Interface**
- No check-in related tests found
- Admin interface for event management needs development
- Attendee tracking system status unknown

**Attendee Management**
- Backend supports attendee counting
- Admin tools for managing attendees not confirmed
- Check-in workflow not implemented

---

## üö® CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

### 1. HIGH PRIORITY - E2E Test Infrastructure Failure
**Problem**: 67% E2E test failure rate with systematic UI interaction issues
**Impact**: Cannot validate complete user workflows
**Recommended Agent**: test-developer
**Details**: Strict mode violations, selector conflicts, tab navigation failures

### 2. HIGH PRIORITY - EventsPage Loading State Issues  
**Problem**: 9/14 unit tests failing due to missing loading indicators
**Impact**: Poor user experience during data loading
**Recommended Agent**: react-developer
**Details**: Missing progressbar role, loading state implementation gaps

### 3. MEDIUM PRIORITY - RSVP Endpoint Status Unknown
**Problem**: Cannot test RSVP functionality without confirmed endpoints
**Impact**: Core feature implementation status unclear
**Recommended Agent**: backend-developer
**Details**: Need RSVP endpoint verification and testing

### 4. MEDIUM PRIORITY - CSS Media Query Warnings
**Problem**: Mantine CSS syntax causing test output pollution
**Impact**: Reduces test readability and may indicate runtime issues
**Recommended Agent**: react-developer
**Details**: @media (max-width: 768px) should be @media (maxWidth: 768px)

## ‚úÖ SUCCESSES TO BUILD UPON

### 1. Solid Backend Foundation
- Events API working perfectly with complete data structure
- Database integration functional with proper querying
- Event type differentiation (Social vs Class) implemented

### 2. Core Component Testing
- EventsList component has excellent test coverage (100% pass rate)
- Unit testing infrastructure working well with Vitest
- MSW integration properly configured for API mocking

### 3. Environment Stability
