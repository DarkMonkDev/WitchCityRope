### ‚ùå BLOCKED - EventSession Tests (WitchCityRope.Api.Tests)
**Command**: `dotnet test tests/WitchCityRope.Api.Tests/ --filter "FullyQualifiedName~EventSessionTests" -v normal`  
**Status**: BLOCKED - 196 compilation errors  
**Root Cause**: Compilation errors in API Tests project  

#### Critical Issues Blocking Execution
1. **UserWithAuth Property Access**: 196 errors related to read-only properties
   ```
   error CS0200: Property or indexer 'UserWithAuth.Id' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only
   error CS0200: Property or indexer 'UserWithAuth.IsActive' cannot be assigned to -- it is read only
   ```

2. **Missing Properties**: Properties not found in UserWithAuth class
   ```
   error CS0117: 'UserWithAuth' does not contain a definition for 'EncryptedLegalName'
   error CS0117: 'UserWithAuth' does not contain a definition for 'DateOfBirth'
   ```

3. **Constructor Issues**: Value object constructors not accepting parameters
   ```
   error CS1729: 'SceneName' does not contain a constructor that takes 1 arguments
   error CS1729: 'EmailAddress' does not contain a constructor that takes 1 arguments
   ```

### ‚ùå BLOCKED - Integration Tests
**Location**: `tests/integration/events/EventSessionMatrixIntegrationTests.cs`  
**Status**: BLOCKED - No corresponding test project  
**Issue**: Integration test file exists but is not part of a compilable test project  

#### EventSession Integration Test Content
- **Test Coverage**: Complete Event Session Matrix workflow
- **Test Types**: 10 comprehensive integration tests covering:
  - End-to-End event creation with sessions
  - Session availability calculations  
  - Multi-session registration scenarios
  - RSVP vs paid registration workflows
  - Complex multi-session capacity tracking
  - Overbooking prevention

## Analysis & Findings

### Current TDD Implementation Status

#### ‚úÖ What's Working (Green Phase)
1. **Core Event Entity Logic**: Complete and robust
   - Event creation, validation, and lifecycle management
   - Capacity management with proper constraints
   - Organizer management with business rules
   - Publishing workflow with state validation
   - Date/time validation with business logic
   - Pricing tier management with ordering

#### üö´ What's Blocked (Cannot Test)
1. **EventSession Entity**: Tests exist but cannot compile
2. **API Layer Integration**: 196 compilation errors prevent execution
3. **Session Matrix Logic**: Complex multi-session functionality untested

### Critical Functionality Assessment

Based on analysis of the test files, the Event Session system is designed to implement:

1. **Session-Based Capacity Management**
   - Events can have multiple sessions (S1, S2, S3)
   - Each session has independent capacity limits
   - Ticket types map to one or more sessions

2. **Complex Ticket Type Scenarios**
   - Full Series Pass: All sessions
   - Weekend Pass: Multiple specific sessions
   - Single Day: Individual session access

3. **Advanced Availability Calculations**
   - Multi-session tickets limited by most constrained session
   - Cross-session capacity tracking
   - Real-time availability updates based on registrations

4. **RSVP vs Paid Registration**
   - Social events: Support free RSVP mode
   - Class events: Always require payment processing (even $0)
   - Different workflows based on event type

### Compilation Error Impact Analysis

**Severity**: CRITICAL - Blocks all API and integration testing  
**Scope**: Affects all test suites that depend on API layer  
**Root Cause**: Breaking changes to UserWithAuth class properties  

The EventSessionTests cannot run because supporting infrastructure (auth system) has compilation errors. This is a cascading failure where authentication system changes broke the event testing infrastructure.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)
1. **Fix Compilation Errors** - Highest priority
   - Update UserWithAuth class usage in test files
   - Fix property assignments and constructor calls
   - Resolve missing property references
   - **Estimated Impact**: Blocks all advanced event testing

2. **Create Proper Integration Test Project**
   - EventSessionMatrixIntegrationTests.cs needs test project structure
   - Add necessary dependencies and configuration
   - **Estimated Impact**: Enables full integration testing

### Medium-Term Actions
1. **Verify EventSession Entity Implementation**
   - Core EventSession class may need implementation
   - Session matrix builders may need development
   - **Estimated Impact**: Enables TDD Red‚ÜíGreen cycle

2. **API Endpoint Development**
   - Event creation with sessions API
   - Ticket availability calculation API  
   - Registration workflow API
   - **Estimated Impact**: Enables full workflow testing

### TDD Status Assessment

**Current Phase**: RED (Tests define desired functionality but implementation missing/blocked)

**Next Phase Requirements**:
1. Fix compilation errors to enable test execution
2. Implement minimal EventSession functionality to make tests pass
3. Develop API endpoints to support integration tests
4. Create full workflow implementation

## Technical Debt Impact

The compilation errors represent significant technical debt that's blocking progress on the Event Session feature. The tests are well-designed and comprehensive, but the infrastructure they depend on is broken.

**Debt Categories**:
1. **Authentication System**: Breaking changes to UserWithAuth
2. **Value Objects**: Constructor signature mismatches  
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Missing properties and methods
4. **Project Structure**: Integration tests not in proper project

## Success Criteria for Next Testing Phase

### Green Light Indicators
- Zero compilation errors in all test projects
- EventSessionTests can execute (currently blocked)
- Integration tests can be discovered and run
- All existing Event tests continue to pass (currently ‚úÖ)

### Quality Gates
- Core Event functionality: ‚úÖ PASSED (31/31 tests)
- EventSession functionality: üö´ BLOCKED (cannot test)
- API integration: üö´ BLOCKED (cannot test)  
- Full workflow: üö´ BLOCKED (cannot test)

## Conclusion

The Event management system has a solid foundation with the Core Event entity tests all passing. However, critical compilation errors are preventing testing of the advanced Event Session functionality that was the focus of this testing request.

**Priority Action**: Resolve the 196 compilation errors in the API Tests project to unblock Event Session testing and enable full TDD workflow for the events management feature.

**Status for Orchestrator**: Core events working, Event Session feature blocked by compilation errors requiring backend-developer intervention.
