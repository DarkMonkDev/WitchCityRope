# System-Level Testing Problem Investigation

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: üö® **CRITICAL SYSTEM ISSUE FOUND**
**Current Pass Rate**: 156/277 (56.3%)
**Failing Tests**: 121
**Investigation Duration**: Full test suite analysis with verbose output

## Executive Summary

### ‚úÖ **YES - There IS a System-Level Problem**

**Root Cause Identified**: **PLAYWRIGHT TEST FILES RUNNING IN VITEST CONTEXT**

**Impact**: 72 out of 97 failed test "files" (74%) are Playwright E2E tests being incorrectly executed by Vitest, causing immediate failures before tests even run.

**Severity**: CRITICAL - This is inflating the failure count and hiding the real unit test issues.

## Investigation Findings

### Test Execution Summary
```
Test Files:  91 failed | 6 passed | 1 skipped (98 total)
Tests:       97 failed | 156 passed | 24 skipped (277 total)
Duration:    71.21s
```

### Critical Discovery: Test Runner Misconfiguration

**Problem**: Vitest (unit test runner) is attempting to execute Playwright E2E test files.

**Evidence**:
```
FAIL  tests/playwright/admin-events-detailed-test.spec.ts
Error: Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here.

FAIL  tests/playwright/events-comprehensive.spec.ts
Error: Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here.

[... 70 more similar failures ...]
```

**Files Affected**: 72 Playwright test files in `/tests/playwright/` directory

**Why This Happens**: Vitest is configured to run against `**/*.spec.ts` pattern, which matches both:
- Vitest unit test files (correct)
- Playwright E2E test files (INCORRECT - should only run with `npx playwright test`)

## Failure Pattern Analysis

### Category 1: Test Runner Misconfiguration (72 files)
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - False failures
- **Pattern**: `Error: Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here.`
- **Affected**: ALL Playwright E2E tests in `/tests/playwright/`
- **Root Cause**: Vitest test pattern includes Playwright files
- **Fix**: Update `vitest.config.ts` to exclude `/tests/playwright/` directory

**Example Files**:
```
tests/playwright/admin-events-detailed-test.spec.ts
tests/playwright/events-comprehensive.spec.ts
tests/playwright/dashboard-comprehensive.spec.ts
[... 69 more ...]
```

### Category 2: Component Rendering Timeout (48 tests)
- **Severity**: HIGH - Test environment issue
- **Pattern**: Tests timeout at ~1000ms waiting for components to render
- **Common Errors**:
  - `Unable to find an element with the text: [component content]`
  - Timeout 1016-1138ms (just over 1000ms default)
- **Root Cause**: Components stuck in loading state, MSW handlers not responding

**Affected Test Files**:
```
src/pages/dashboard/__tests__/DashboardPage.test.tsx (12 tests)
src/pages/dashboard/__tests__/EventsPage.test.tsx (10 tests)
src/pages/dashboard/__tests__/ProfilePage.test.tsx (11 tests)
src/pages/dashboard/__tests__/MembershipPage.test.tsx (6 tests)
src/pages/dashboard/__tests__/SecurityPage.test.tsx (9 tests)
```

**Pattern**: Tests succeed during loading check, then fail when checking for actual content after data loads.

### Category 3: MSW Handler Not Triggering Error State (5 tests)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Test configuration issue
- **Pattern**: Error handlers defined but success handlers still respond
- **Errors**:
  - "Unable to find an element with the text: Failed to load..."
  - "Unable to find an element with the text: Unable to Load..."
- **Root Cause**: MSW handler override priority issue

**Affected Tests**:
```
DashboardPage > should handle dashboard loading error
EventsPage > should handle events loading error
ProfilePage > should handle user loading error
MembershipPage > should handle user loading error
(1 more in integration tests)
```

### Category 4: React Query Cache Not Clearing (10 tests)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - Test isolation issue
- **Pattern**: `expected false to be true` or `expected data to be empty but got cached data`
- **Root Cause**: React Query cache persisting between tests

**Affected Tests**:
```
Dashboard Integration Tests > useCurrentUser Integration > should handle user fetch error
Dashboard Integration Tests > useCurrentUser Integration > should handle network timeout
Dashboard Integration Tests > useEvents Integration > should fetch events data successfully
[... 7 more ...]
```

### Category 5: Form Field Label Mismatches (9 tests)
- **Severity**: LOW - Test expectations vs implementation
- **Pattern**: `Unable to find a label with the text of: Scene Name` (7 instances)
- **Root Cause**: Component uses different label text than test expects

**Common Issues**:
```
Expected: "Scene Name"
Actual: Different label or no label

Expected: "Email Address"
Actual: Different label or no label
```

### Category 6: useVettingStatus Hook Failures (16 tests)
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - API response structure mismatch
- **Pattern**: `expected undefined to be 'Approved'`
- **Root Cause**: MSW mock response not matching expected DTO structure

**Affected**: `src/features/vetting/hooks/useVettingStatus.test.tsx` (16 of 18 tests failing)

### Category 7: Auth Store checkAuth Failures (4 tests)
- **Severity**: HIGH - Core auth functionality
- **Pattern**: `expected { success: true } to deeply equal { id: '1', ... }`
- **Root Cause**: API response returning wrong structure or test expecting wrong structure

**Affected**: `src/stores/__tests__/authStore.test.ts`

### Category 8: Miscellaneous Individual Issues (5 tests)
- EventsList component rendering issues (2 tests)
- Auth flow navigation issues (2 tests)
- VettingApplicationsList filter issues (1 test)

## System-Level Issues Identified

### üö® Issue 1: Playwright Tests in Vitest Runner
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Affected Tests**: 72 test FILES (not counted in 277 total tests)
- **Root Cause**: `vitest.config.ts` glob pattern includes Playwright files
- **Evidence**: All 72 failures show identical error: "Playwright Test did not expect test.describe() to be called here."
- **Fix Required**: Update vitest configuration to exclude `/tests/playwright/**/*.spec.ts`

**Impact**: This is NOT affecting the 277 test count (those are actual Vitest tests), but it's causing 72 additional file-level failures that clutter the output.

### üö® Issue 2: MSW Handler Response Timing
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Affected Tests**: ~48 tests (17% of suite)
- **Root Cause**: MSW handlers not responding before component timeout
- **Evidence**: Consistent 1000-1100ms timeout pattern across multiple test files
- **Fix Required**:
  1. Investigate MSW handler registration timing
  2. Verify `server.listen()` called before tests
  3. Check React Query `retry: false` configuration consistency

**Impact**: This IS a system issue - same problem affecting multiple test files with same pattern.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 3: React Query Test Isolation
- **Severity**: MEDIUM
- **Affected Tests**: ~10 tests (4% of suite)
- **Root Cause**: QueryClient cache not being properly cleared between tests
- **Evidence**: Tests failing with cached data from previous tests
- **Fix Required**: Ensure `beforeEach` creates fresh QueryClient instance in ALL test files

**Impact**: Test environment configuration issue affecting multiple files.

## NOT System-Level Issues (Individual Test Problems)

### Category: Form Field Labels (9 tests)
- **Why NOT System Issue**: Each test file may use different component versions
- **Fix Approach**: Update individual test expectations to match actual component labels

### Category: useVettingStatus Hook (16 tests)
- **Why NOT System Issue**: Isolated to single test file
- **Fix Approach**: Fix MSW mock responses in that one test file

### Category: Auth Store Tests (4 tests)
- **Why NOT System Issue**: Isolated to single test file
- **Fix Approach**: Fix API response structure expectations

## Real Test Failure Count Analysis

### Current Reporting
```
Test Files:  91 failed | 6 passed | 1 skipped (98)
Tests:       97 failed | 156 passed | 24 skipped (277)
```

### Actual Breakdown
**Total 97 Failed Tests**:
- Playwright misconfiguration: 72 FILE failures (not in 277 count)
- Real Vitest failures: 97 TESTS (in 277 count)

**Real Vitest Test Failures by Category**:
1. Component rendering timeouts: ~48 tests (SYSTEM ISSUE)
2. useVettingStatus hook: 16 tests (single file issue)
3. React Query cache: ~10 tests (SYSTEM ISSUE)
4. Form label mismatches: 9 tests (individual issues)
5. MSW error handlers: 5 tests (SYSTEM ISSUE)
6. Auth store: 4 tests (single file issue)
7. Miscellaneous: 5 tests (individual issues)

**TOTAL**: 97 failed tests

## System Issues Summary

| System Issue | Tests Affected | % of Failures | Fix Complexity |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Playwright in Vitest | 72 files | 74% of file failures | 5 min (config change) |
| MSW Handler Timing | ~48 tests | 49% of test failures | 2-4 hours |
| React Query Isolation | ~10 tests | 10% of test failures | 1-2 hours |
| MSW Error Handlers | ~5 tests | 5% of test failures | 1 hour |

**Total System Issues**: ~63 tests (65% of 97 failures)
**Total Individual Issues**: ~34 tests (35% of 97 failures)

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Playwright Configuration (5 minutes)
**Impact**: Eliminate 72 false failures from test output
**Fix**: Update `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web/vitest.config.ts`

```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    exclude: [
      '**/node_modules/**',
      '**/dist/**',
      '**/cypress/**',
      '**/.{idea,git,cache,output,temp}/**',
      '**/tests/playwright/**', // ADD THIS LINE
      '**/{karma,rollup,webpack,vite,vitest,jest,ava,babel,nyc,cypress,tsup,build}.config.*'
    ],
    // ... rest of config
  }
})
```

**Result**: Clean test output showing only actual Vitest test results

### Priority 2: Fix MSW Handler Timing (2-4 hours)
**Impact**: Fix ~48 tests (40% of real failures)

**Investigation Steps**:
1. Check if `server.listen()` called in setup files
2. Verify MSW handlers registered before component render
3. Add debug logging to MSW handlers to see if they're called
4. Check if components have hardcoded timeouts causing failures
5. Verify API_BASE_URL consistency across test files

**Likely Fix**: MSW setup in `src/test/setup.ts` may not be properly initialized.

### Priority 3: Fix React Query Test Isolation (1-2 hours)
**Impact**: Fix ~10 tests (8% of real failures)

**Fix Approach**:
1. Review all test files using React Query
2. Ensure `beforeEach` creates NEW QueryClient instance
3. Add `queryClient.clear()` in `afterEach` hooks
4. Follow pattern from working test: `/apps/web/src/test/integration/auth-flow-simplified.test.tsx`

### Priority 4: Fix MSW Error Handler Priority (1 hour)
**Impact**: Fix ~5 tests (4% of real failures)

**Fix Approach**:
1. Use `server.use()` in individual tests to override handlers
2. Ensure error responses use `HttpResponse.error()` or proper status codes
3. Clear handlers after error tests with `server.resetHandlers()`

### Priority 5: Individual Test Fixes (3-4 hours)
**Impact**: Fix remaining ~34 tests (28% of real failures)

**Categories**:
- useVettingStatus: Fix MSW mocks (16 tests, 1 hour)
- Form labels: Update expectations (9 tests, 1 hour)
- Auth store: Fix response structure (4 tests, 30 min)
- Miscellaneous: Individual investigation (5 tests, 1-2 hours)

## Estimated Impact of Fixes

### After Priority 1 Fix (Playwright config)
- **File failures**: 91 ‚Üí 19 (80% reduction)
- **Test count**: Still 97 failed (no change - different metric)
- **Output quality**: MUCH cleaner, easier to debug

### After Priority 2 Fix (MSW timing)
- **Test failures**: 97 ‚Üí 49 (50% reduction)
- **Pass rate**: 56.3% ‚Üí 77.6% (21% improvement)
- **Target met**: Would EXCEED 70-75% adjusted target

### After Priority 3-4 Fixes (React Query + MSW errors)
- **Test failures**: 49 ‚Üí 34 (15 more tests)
- **Pass rate**: 77.6% ‚Üí 83.4% (6% improvement)
- **Target met**: Would EXCEED 80% original target

### After Priority 5 Fixes (Individual issues)
- **Test failures**: 34 ‚Üí 0 (all fixed)
- **Pass rate**: 83.4% ‚Üí 100% (theoretical maximum)

## Answer to Original Question

### Is there a system-level problem?
**YES - THREE CRITICAL SYSTEM ISSUES**

### What are they?
1. **Playwright tests running in Vitest** (72 file failures)
2. **MSW handler timing/registration** (~48 test failures)
3. **React Query cache isolation** (~10 test failures)

### How many tests affected?
- **Playwright issue**: 72 FILE-level failures (not in 277 count)
- **MSW + React Query**: ~58 TEST failures (60% of 97 failing tests)
- **Total system impact**: ~63% of all test failures are systemic

### What's the fix?
**See Priority 1-4 recommendations above** (8-12 hours total to fix all system issues)

### Priority order for all fixes
1. **IMMEDIATE** (5 min): Fix Playwright config ‚Üí clean output
2. **HIGH** (2-4 hours): Fix MSW handler timing ‚Üí +48 tests passing
3. **MEDIUM** (1-2 hours): Fix React Query isolation ‚Üí +10 tests passing
4. **MEDIUM** (1 hour): Fix MSW error handlers ‚Üí +5 tests passing
5. **LOW** (3-4 hours): Fix individual test issues ‚Üí +34 tests passing

**TOTAL EFFORT**: 8-12 hours to achieve 100% pass rate (or 3-7 hours to hit 80% target)

## Key Insights for Stakeholder

### Why This Wasn't Obvious Before
1. **Mixed metrics**: File failures (98) vs test failures (97) confused the picture
2. **Vitest runs Playwright files**: Cluttered output with 72 irrelevant errors
3. **Common timeout pattern**: MSW timing issue looked like individual test problems
4. **Previous investigation**: Focused on wrong categories (text mismatches vs environment)

### What This Explains
1. **Why fixes didn't help**: We were fixing symptoms, not root cause
2. **Why pass rate stuck at 56%**: System issues affecting half the suite
3. **Why "quick wins" didn't exist**: Most failures are environmental, not test code

### What This Means
1. **System issues ARE fixable**: Not architecture problems, just configuration
2. **High ROI available**: Fix 3 system issues ‚Üí 60% of failures gone
3. **Recommended path**: Fix Priority 1-3 (3-7 hours) to exceed 80% target

## Files Modified During Investigation

3. `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/test-results/system-level-problem-investigation-20251006.md` - This report

## Next Steps

### Recommended Immediate Action
**Fix Playwright configuration FIRST** - 5 minute fix that eliminates 72 false failures and makes debugging much easier.

### Then Proceed With
**MSW handler timing investigation** - Highest impact fix (48 tests = 17% improvement in pass rate).

### Success Criteria
After fixing system issues (Priorities 1-3):
- ‚úÖ Pass rate >80% (from 56.3%)
- ‚úÖ Clean test output (no Playwright errors)
- ‚úÖ Consistent test execution (no timing issues)
- ‚úÖ Test isolation working (no cache pollution)
