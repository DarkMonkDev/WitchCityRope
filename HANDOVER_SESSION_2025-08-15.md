# Session Handover - August 15, 2025

## Session Summary
**Duration**: ~3.5 hours
**Focus**: React migration infrastructure setup and workflow preparation
**Result**: Complete infrastructure ready for vertical slice implementation

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Repository Infrastructure ✅
- Created monorepo with Turborepo
- React app with Vite + TypeScript
- .NET API with health endpoint
- Docker configuration
- All dependencies installed and tested

### 2. Documentation Migration ✅
- 575 files migrated from original repository
- AI workflow system fully operational
- All agents updated for React development

### 3. Workflow System ✅
- Created /orchestrate command
- All sub-agents configured:
  - react-developer (new)
  - ui-designer (updated)
  - backend-developer
  - test-developer
  - test-executor
  - lint-validator (new)
  - prettier-formatter (new)
  - librarian

### 4. Documentation Cleanup ✅
- Removed ALL Blazor references
- Consolidated lessons learned (one file per agent)
- Clean structure achieved

## Current State

### Working Systems
- React app runs: `npm run dev --prefix apps/web`
- API runs: `cd apps/api && dotnet run`
- Docker configured (may conflict with old project ports)
- All build tools verified

### File Structure
```
witchcityrope-react/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/        (React app)
│   └── api/        (.NET API)
├── packages/       (shared code)
├── docs/           (complete documentation)
├── .claude/        (AI agents)
└── tests/          (test suites)
```

## How to Continue

### 1. Start New Claude Code Session
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
claude-code .
```

### 2. Quick Orientation
- Read `MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md` for current status
- Check `/docs/functional-areas/vertical-slice-home-page/README.md` for next task
- Review `/docs/lessons-learned/LESSONS_LEARNED_SYSTEM.md` for documentation standards

### 3. Execute Vertical Slice with Full Workflow

#### Copy and paste this command:
```
/orchestrate Implement a vertical slice for the home page that displays events. This is a test of the full workflow process. Create a simple GET /api/events endpoint with mock data, a React HomePage component that fetches and displays the events, and an E2E test. Follow all 5 phases with proper sub-agent delegation and enforce quality gates.
```

### 4. Expected Workflow Execution

The orchestrate command will:

**Phase 1: Requirements**
- Analyze existing home page
- Define event data structure
- Create requirements document
- **PAUSE for human review**

**Phase 2: Design**
- ui-designer creates mockups
- Define API specification
- Plan component structure

**Phase 3: Implementation**
- backend-developer creates Events controller
- react-developer creates HomePage component
- **PAUSE for human review**

**Phase 4: Testing**
- test-developer writes tests
- test-executor runs tests
- lint-validator checks code quality (MANDATORY)

**Phase 5: Finalization**
- prettier-formatter formats code (MANDATORY)
- librarian updates documentation
- Capture lessons learned

## Important Reminders

### Quality Gates Are Mandatory
- lint-validator MUST run in Phase 4
- prettier-formatter MUST run in Phase 5
- These are NOT optional

### File Registry
- Every file created/modified must be logged
- Check `/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`

### Access Old Project
From the React project, reference Blazor code:
```bash
# Example: View original Events controller
cat ../witchcityrope/src/WitchCityRope.Api/Features/Events/EventsController.cs
```

### Docker Ports
Old project may be using ports 5433, 5653. Either:
- Stop old project: `docker stop witchcity-postgres witchcity-api`
- Or use different ports in docker-compose.yml

## Success Criteria

The vertical slice is complete when:
1. Home page displays mock events from API
2. All 5 workflow phases executed
3. All quality gates passed
4. E2E test verifies functionality
5. Lessons learned documented

## Troubleshooting

### If Sub-Agents Don't Work
- Ensure you're in `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react`
- Check `.claude/agents/` directory exists
- Verify agents have correct file extensions (.md)

### If Orchestrate Command Not Found
- Check `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md` exists
- Try restarting Claude Code from project root

### If Tests Fail
- Ensure old project isn't using same ports
- Check npm dependencies installed: `npm install`
- Verify .NET restored: `cd apps/api && dotnet restore`

## Final Notes

The infrastructure is completely ready. The vertical slice will:
- Test the entire workflow process
- Validate all sub-agents work correctly
- Establish patterns for the migration
- Prove the React ↔ API communication

Everything is documented and committed. The next session can pick up exactly where we left off using the orchestrate command above.

**Good luck with the vertical slice implementation!**
