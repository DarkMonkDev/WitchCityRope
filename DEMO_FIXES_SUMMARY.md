# Event Session Matrix Demo - UI Issues Fixed

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ Ad-Hoc Email Target Sessions Issue
**Problem**: When clicking "Send Ad-Hoc Email", the Target Sessions selector was hidden.
**Solution**: 
- Added a new Ad-Hoc Email section in the Emails tab
- Created expandable form that shows when "Send Ad-Hoc Email" button is clicked
- Added Target Sessions MultiSelect with proper validation
- Shows participant count when sessions are selected
- Includes Cancel and Send buttons with proper state management

**Files Modified**: 
- `/apps/web/src/components/events/EventForm.tsx` - Added state management and Ad-Hoc Email form

### 2. ✅ Input Box Animations and Colors
**Problem**: Input boxes were not using the approved WitchCityRope brand colors and animations.
**Solution**:
- Applied `form-input-animated` CSS class to all input fields
- Added custom Mantine styles with burgundy border color (`var(--color-burgundy)`)
- Implemented smooth transitions on focus with brand colors
- Added burgundy focus states and box-shadow effects

**Files Modified**: 
- `/apps/web/src/components/events/EventForm.tsx` - Updated all TextInput, Select, MultiSelect, and Textarea components
- Used existing CSS variables from `/apps/web/src/index.css`

**Brand Colors Applied**:
- Primary: `--color-burgundy: #880124`
- Focus states use burgundy with smooth transitions
- All input animations now follow the approved design system

### 3. ✅ Scroll Issue on Emails Tab  
**Problem**: When scrolling down on the Emails tab, random text and exclamation icons appeared.
**Solution**:
- Added `overflow: hidden` to the Emails tab panel
- Added `position: relative` and `z-index: 1` to the Stack container
- Prevents content from bleeding outside the tab boundaries

**Files Modified**: 
- `/apps/web/src/components/events/EventForm.tsx` - Added styling to Emails tab panel
