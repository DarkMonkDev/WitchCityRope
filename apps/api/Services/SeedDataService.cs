/// <summary>
/// Service responsible for populating database seed data for development and testing.
/// Implements comprehensive test data creation using EF Core patterns and transaction management.
/// 
/// Key features:
/// - Idempotent operations (safe to run multiple times)
/// - Transaction-based consistency with rollback capability
/// - Proper UTC DateTime handling following ApplicationDbContext patterns
/// - ASP.NET Core Identity integration for test accounts
/// - Structured logging for operational visibility
/// - Result pattern for error handling and reporting
/// 
/// Seed data includes:
/// - 5 test accounts covering all role scenarios (Admin, Teacher, Member, Guest, Organizer)
/// - 8 sample events (6 upcoming, 2 past) with 3 classes and 3 social events
/// - Sessions for each event with varied scenarios
/// - Ticket types with varied pricing models (sliding scale, early bird, full event packages)
/// - Sample ticket purchases and RSVPs with realistic payment data
/// - EventParticipation records for proper RSVP/ticket testing
/// - Volunteer positions demonstrating event management functionality
/// - Vetting applications (up to 11 total) with comprehensive status examples
/// - Vetting status configuration for development workflows
/// 
/// Implementation follows existing service layer patterns and coding standards.
