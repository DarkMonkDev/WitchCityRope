**Date**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Components Created**: 3 files modified/created  

## What Was Delivered

### 1. EventRegistrationModal Component

- ✅ `useRegisterForEvent()` - Handles ticket-based registration
- ✅ `useCancelRegistration()` - Handles registration cancellation
- ✅ Optimistic updates for capacity tracking
- ✅ Proper error handling and rollback
- ✅ Query invalidation for data consistency
- ✅ TypeScript interface for `RegistrationData`

**Features**:
- Optimistically updates event capacity while API call is pending
- Rolls back changes if API call fails
- Invalidates related queries to ensure data consistency
- Proper error logging and user feedback

- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Consistent with existing WitchCityRope styling

## Technical Implementation Details

### Form Validation
- ✅ Ticket type selection required
- ✅ Quantity validation (min 1, max available)
- ✅ Multiple purchase restrictions enforced
- ✅ Payment method selection required

### Price Calculations
- ✅ Base ticket price calculation
- ✅ Early bird discount application (percentage-based)
- ✅ Quantity-based totals
- ✅ Real-time price updates

### User Experience
- ✅ Loading states during registration
- ✅ Success notifications on completion
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly messages
- ✅ Modal can be cancelled at any time
- ✅ Form resets properly on success/cancel

### Data Flow
```
EventDetailsPage → Opens Modal → User Selects Options → 
Form Validation → Mutation Triggered → Optimistic Update → 
API Call → Success/Error Handling → UI Update
```

## Mock Data Structure

The implementation includes comprehensive mock ticket types for demonstration:

1. **General Admission** ($45.00)
   - Multiple sessions included
   - Multiple purchases allowed
   - 38 of 50 tickets available

2. **VIP Access** ($63.75 after 15% early bird discount)
   - All sessions included
   - Single purchase only
   - Early bird pricing with savings display
   - 17 of 20 tickets available

3. **Student Rate** ($25.00)
   - Limited sessions included
   - Single purchase only
   - 7 of 15 tickets available

## API Integration Ready

### Backend Requirements (Stubs Only)
The frontend is ready for backend integration with these endpoints:
- `POST /api/events/{eventId}/register` - Process registration
- `DELETE /api/events/{eventId}/registration/{registrationId}` - Cancel registration

### Data Contract
```typescript
interface RegistrationData {
  eventId: string;
  ticketTypeId: string;
  quantity: number;
  paymentMethod: 'paypal' | 'venmo';
  totalAmount: number;
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. ✅ Open modal and test ticket selection
2. ✅ Test quantity validation for different ticket types
3. ✅ Verify price calculations with early bird discounts
4. ✅ Test payment method selection
5. ✅ Test form submission (mock success/error responses)
6. ✅ Test modal close/cancel functionality

### Automated Testing (To Be Added)
- Unit tests for price calculations
- Integration tests for modal workflow
- E2E tests for full registration flow

## Production Readiness

### What's Complete
- ✅ Full UI components with proper styling
- ✅ Form validation and error handling
- ✅ State management integration
- ✅ TypeScript typing throughout
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility considerations

### What Needs Backend Integration
- ⏳ Actual API endpoints for registration
- ⏳ Real ticket type data from database
- ⏳ Payment processing integration
- ⏳ Email confirmation system
- ⏳ Registration status persistence

## File Registry Updated

All file changes have been properly logged in the project file registry at:
`/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Backend API Development** - Implement registration endpoints
2. **Payment Integration** - Replace stubs with real PayPal/Venmo
3. **Testing Suite** - Add comprehensive tests
4. **Email Notifications** - Registration confirmations
5. **Real Data** - Replace mock tickets with database queries
