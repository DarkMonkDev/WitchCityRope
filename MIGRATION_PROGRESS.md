## Important Notes

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Documentation System**: ✅ Fully migrated and operational
2. **AI Workflow**: ✅ Preserved and updated for React
3. **File Registry**: ✅ System in place for tracking
4. **Development Environment**: ✅ Ready for API migration

### For Next Developer Session
1. Start with Day 3-4 API migration tasks
2. Use existing documentation in docs/architecture/react-migration/
3. Follow step-by-step-implementation.md for detailed instructions
4. Maintain file registry for all new files
5. Test AI agents before major changes

The project is in excellent shape with all critical infrastructure in place. The next phase (API migration) can begin immediately.

## Day 3 Tasks - Vertical Slice Development (In Progress)

### Workflow System Updates
- [x] Created /orchestrate command from orchestrator sub-agent
- [x] Created react-developer sub-agent (replacing blazor-developer)
- [x] Updated ui-designer sub-agent for React/Chakra UI
