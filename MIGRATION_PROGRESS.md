# WitchCityRope React Migration Progress

## Migration Status Overview
- **Start Date**: 2025-08-15
- **Current Phase**: Ready for Vertical Slice Implementation
- **Overall Progress**: Infrastructure Complete, Ready for Development
- **Last Updated**: 2025-08-15 (End of Day 3)

## Completed Work

### ✅ Day 1: Repository Foundation (COMPLETE)
- Monorepo structure with Turborepo
- React app with Vite + TypeScript initialized
- .NET API project structure created
- 35+ npm packages installed (Chakra UI, Zustand, TanStack Query, React Router v7)
- TypeScript paths and aliases configured
- ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Git repository with clean commit history

### ✅ Day 2: Critical Documentation Migration (COMPLETE)
- Migrated 575 files from original repository
- Complete docs/ directory (488 files)
- .claude/ AI agent system (23 files)
- Session work archives (64 files)
- Updated CLAUDE.md for React development
- AI workflow orchestration preserved and functional

### ✅ Day 3: Workflow System Preparation (COMPLETE)
- Created /orchestrate command from orchestrator sub-agent
- Created react-developer sub-agent (React expertise)
- Updated ui-designer sub-agent for React/Chakra UI
- Created lint-validator and prettier-formatter agents
- Complete documentation cleanup:
  - Removed ALL Blazor references from workflow docs
  - Consolidated lessons learned (one file per agent)
  - Archived obsolete documentation
- Docker configuration created (docker-compose.yml, Dockerfiles)
- Baseline testing confirmed:
  - React app runs on localhost:5173
  - .NET API health check working
  - Build tools verified

## Current Infrastructure Status

### Working Systems ✅
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo orchestration functional
- **React App**: Vite dev server with hot reload
- **API**: .NET 9 with health endpoint
- **Documentation**: Complete AI workflow system
- **Sub-Agents**: All configured for React development
- **Quality Gates**: Lint and Prettier integrated
- **Docker**: Configuration ready (ports may conflict with old project)

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.2.2 + Vite 5.3.1
- **UI**: Chakra UI 3.24.2 + Tailwind CSS 4.1.12
- **State**: Zustand 5.0.7 + TanStack Query 5.85.3
- **Routing**: React Router 7.8.1
- **Forms**: React Hook Form 7.62.0 + Zod 4.0.17
- **Backend**: .NET 9 Web API with Swagger
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured in Docker)
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library + Playwright

## Ready for Next Phase: Vertical Slice

### Working Folder Prepared
`/docs/functional-areas/vertical-slice-home-page/`
- Requirements folder
- Design folder
- Implementation folder
- Testing folder
- Lessons-learned folder
- README with workflow phases
- WORKFLOW_QUALITY_GATES.md

### Sub-Agents Ready
- **ui-designer**: Mockups and wireframes
- **backend-developer**: API development
- **react-developer**: React components
- **test-developer**: Test writing
- **test-executor**: Test running
- **lint-validator**: Code quality
- **prettier-formatter**: Code formatting
- **librarian**: Documentation

### Vertical Slice Scope
**Goal**: Implement a minimal home page that displays events from the API
- Create Events API endpoint with mock data
- Create React home page component
- Setup API integration with Axios/TanStack Query
- Write E2E test with Playwright
- Document lessons learned

## How to Continue

### 1. Start Claude Code in Project Directory
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
claude-code .
```

### 2. Use the Orchestrate Command
The `/orchestrate` command is ready to coordinate the full workflow with all sub-agents.

### 3. Access Old Project When Needed
Reference the original Blazor project for API code to migrate:
```bash
# From witchcityrope-react directory:
../witchcityrope/src/WitchCityRope.Api/
../witchcityrope/src/WitchCityRope.Core/
```

## Important Notes

### Documentation Standards
- Every file operation MUST be logged in file registry
- Each agent has their own lessons-learned file
- Use LESSONS_LEARNED_SYSTEM.md for guidance

### Workflow Process
- Phase 1: Requirements (with human review)
- Phase 2: Design
- Phase 3: Implementation (with human review after first slice)
- Phase 4: Testing (with mandatory lint validation)
- Phase 5: Finalization (with mandatory formatting)

### Known Issues
- Docker ports may conflict with old project on 5433, 5653
- Either stop old project or use different ports

## Session Summary

**Session Date**: 2025-08-15
**Duration**: ~3 hours
**Commits**: 17 commits documenting all progress

**Major Achievements**:
1. Complete React+TypeScript infrastructure
2. AI workflow system migrated and updated
3. Documentation fully cleaned and organized
4. Sub-agents configured and tested
5. Ready for vertical slice implementation

**Next Immediate Task**: Execute vertical slice using /orchestrate command to test the full workflow with all phases and quality gates.
