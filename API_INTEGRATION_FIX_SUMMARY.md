# API Integration Fix Summary

## Critical Issue Fixed: Mock Data Replaced with Real API Data

**Problem**: The frontend was displaying hardcoded mock events that didn't exist in the database, causing user confusion and broken event detail pages.

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **API Response Structure Mismatch**: API returns `{ events: [...] }` but frontend hooks expected array directly
2. **Field Name Differences**: API uses different field names than frontend types (e.g., `startDateTime` vs `startDate`)
3. **Mock Data Fallback**: EventsListPage was using mock data instead of API data
4. **Proxy Configuration Error**: Vite proxy was targeting wrong port (5655 vs 5653)
5. **Missing Single Event API Call**: EventDetailPage had no API integration

## Files Modified

### 1. `/apps/web/src/lib/api/hooks/useEvents.ts`
- **Added API response interfaces** to match backend structure
- **Added transformation function** to map API fields to frontend types
- **Fixed useEvents hook** to handle `{ events: [...] }` response format
- **Fixed useEvent hook** for single event fetching

### 2. `/apps/web/src/pages/events/EventsListPage.tsx`
- **Removed all mock data** (58 lines of hardcoded event objects)
- **Updated to use real API data only**
- **Fixed event card links** to use correct event IDs from API
- **Updated pricing display** to use calculated values based on capacity

### 3. `/apps/web/src/pages/events/EventDetailPage.tsx`
- **Complete rewrite** to use real API data instead of mock data
- **Added useEvent hook integration** for fetching individual events
- **Added loading states and error handling**
- **Simplified UI** to work with actual event data structure
- **Fixed navigation** to use real event titles in breadcrumbs

### 4. `/apps/web/vite.config.ts`
- **Fixed proxy target port** from 5655 to 5653
- **API proxy now correctly routes to running backend server**

## API Field Mapping

The transformation layer handles these field differences:

| API Field | Frontend Field | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| `startDateTime` | `startDate` | ISO datetime string |
| `endDateTime` | `endDate` | ISO datetime string |
| `maxAttendees` | `capacity` | Number of maximum attendees |
| `currentAttendees` | `registrationCount` | Current registration count |

## Testing & Verification

Created comprehensive tests to verify the fix:

### API Integration Test (`test-api-integration.js`)
- ✅ Verifies API endpoint returns real events
- ✅ Confirms proxy routing works correctly  
- ✅ Tests single event endpoint functionality
- ✅ Validates data structure matches frontend expectations

### Browser Display Test (`test-real-events-display.js`)
- ✅ Confirms real events display in browser
- ✅ Verifies no mock data appears in UI
- ✅ Tests event detail page navigation
- ✅ Validates end-to-end user flow

## Results

**Before Fix:**
- Users saw: "February Rope Jam", "3-Day Rope Intensive Series" (mock data)
- Clicking events led to wrong/missing details
- Event IDs didn't match between list and detail pages

**After Fix:**
- Users see: "Introduction to Rope Bondage", "Midnight Rope Performance", etc. (real data)
- All event links work correctly with proper event IDs
- Event detail pages display actual event information
- No mock data anywhere in the system

## User Experience Impact

- **Fixed broken user journey**: Users can now click events and see correct details
- **Accurate event information**: All displayed events actually exist and can be registered for
- **Consistent data flow**: List page → Detail page uses same event data
- **Real-time accuracy**: Events reflect current database state

## Next Steps

1. **Test registration flow** with real event IDs
2. **Verify payment integration** works with actual events
3. **Test capacity management** with real registration counts
4. **Monitor API performance** under normal load

## Files Created (Testing)

- `test-api-integration.js` - API integration verification
- `test-real-events-display.js` - Browser display verification
- `API_INTEGRATION_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation

## Technical Notes

- **No breaking changes** to existing API endpoints
- **Backward compatible** transformation layer
- **Error handling** for missing or malformed API responses
- **Loading states** for better user experience
- **Type safety** maintained throughout the transformation

This fix resolves the critical disconnect between frontend display and backend data, ensuring users see accurate, actionable event information.
