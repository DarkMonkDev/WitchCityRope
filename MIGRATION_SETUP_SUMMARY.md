# EF Core Migration Setup Summary

## Current Status

I've set up the basic infrastructure for Entity Framework Core migrations in your WitchCityRope project:

### 1. ✅ DbContext Configuration
- The `WitchCityRopeDbContext` is properly configured in the Infrastructure project
- It includes all entity configurations
- Audit field tracking is implemented

### 2. ✅ Connection String Configuration
- SQLite connection string is configured in appsettings.json
- Default database location: `witchcityrope.db` in the API project directory
- Development database: `witchcityrope_dev.db`

### 3. ✅ Dependency Injection Setup
- Infrastructure services are registered via `AddInfrastructure()` extension method
- DbContext is registered with SQLite provider
- Connection string fallback is configured

### 4. ✅ EF Core Tools
- dotnet-ef tool is installed locally in the project
- Tool manifest created at `.config/dotnet-tools.json`

### 5. ✅ Design-Time Factory
- Created `DesignTimeDbContextFactory.cs` for migration generation
- Configured with appsettings.json support

## Commands to Run Migrations

### Create Initial Migration
From the repository root directory:
```bash
dotnet dotnet-ef migrations add InitialCreate --project src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure --startup-project src/WitchCityRope.Api
```

### Apply Migrations to Database
```bash
dotnet dotnet-ef database update --project src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure --startup-project src/WitchCityRope.Api
```

### Alternative: Run from API directory
```bash
cd src/WitchCityRope.Api
dotnet ef database update
```

## Current Issues to Resolve

### 1. Build Errors
The project has several build errors that need to be fixed before migrations can be created:
- Nullable reference type warnings (temporarily disabled)
- Namespace conflicts between SendGrid and Core EmailAddress types
- Namespace conflicts between PayPal and Core Money types
- Missing interface implementations in EmailService and PayPalService

### 2. Package Issues
- Fixed: OtpNet → Otp.NET package name
- Several packages have security vulnerabilities that should be updated

### 3. Recommendations
1. Fix the build errors in the Infrastructure project
2. Re-enable nullable reference types after fixing all nullable issues
3. Update vulnerable packages
4. Create and apply the initial migration
5. Test the database creation and seeding

## Next Steps
1. Fix the namespace conflicts and interface implementations
2. Build the solution successfully
3. Create the initial migration
4. Test database operations

The infrastructure is properly set up for migrations, but the build errors need to be resolved first.
