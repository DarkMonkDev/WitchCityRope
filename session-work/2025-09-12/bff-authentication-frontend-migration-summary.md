# BFF Authentication Frontend Migration Summary

**Date**: September 12, 2025  
**Status**: Core Migration Complete  
**Next Steps**: Testing and cleanup remaining TypeScript errors

## Overview

Successfully migrated the React frontend from localStorage-based JWT tokens to httpOnly cookie-based authentication, implementing the BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) pattern.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Auth Service (`/apps/web/src/services/authService.ts`)

**Removed:**
- All localStorage token management
- `private token` storage and related methods
- `getToken()`, `setToken()`, `isTokenExpired()` methods
- Token storage in `login()` and `register()` responses

**Updated:**
- All API calls now use `credentials: 'include'` for httpOnly cookies
- `login()` and `register()` return only user data (no tokens)
- `getCurrentUser()` relies on cookies for authentication
- `logout()` calls API endpoint to clear server-side cookie

### 2. Updated Auth Store (`/apps/web/src/stores/authStore.ts`)

**Removed:**
- `token` and `tokenExpiresAt` from state interface
- `getToken()` and `isTokenExpired()` from actions
- Token parameters from `login()` action
- Token persistence in Zustand middleware

**Updated:**
- `login()` action now takes only user parameter: `login(user: UserDto)`
- `checkAuth()` uses direct fetch with `credentials: 'include'`
- Simplified state management without token complexity
- Updated persistence to only store user data and auth status

### 3. Updated API Clients

**`/apps/web/src/lib/api/client.ts`:**
- Removed all Authorization header logic
- Simplified request interceptors (auth handled by cookies)
- Updated error handling to clear auth state without token cleanup

**`/apps/web/src/api/client.ts`:**
- Removed token injection from request interceptors
- Updated error handling for httpOnly cookie pattern

### 4. Added Silent Refresh Hook (`/apps/web/src/hooks/useAuthRefresh.ts`)

**Features:**
- Automatic token refresh every 25 minutes
- Uses `/api/auth/refresh` endpoint with httpOnly cookies
- Prevents user logout from token expiration
- Graceful error handling

### 5. Updated App Component (`/apps/web/src/App.tsx`)

**Added:**
- `useAuthRefresh()` hook for automatic token refresh
- Updated comments to reflect httpOnly cookie authentication

### 6. Updated Auth Context (`/apps/web/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Updated:**
- Comments to reference httpOnly cookies instead of JWT tokens
- Authentication restoration logic

### 7. Updated Route Loaders (`/apps/web/src/routes/loaders/authLoader.ts`)

**Updated:**
- Removed JWT token validation logic
- Uses httpOnly cookies for authentication check
- Simplified `login()` call without token parameters

## Security Improvements

✅ **httpOnly Cookies**: Tokens no longer accessible to JavaScript  
✅ **XSS Protection**: Eliminates token theft via cross-site scripting  
✅ **Automatic Refresh**: Prevents user logout from token expiration  
✅ **Multi-tab Sync**: Cookie-based auth works across browser tabs  
✅ **CSRF Protection**: SameSite cookie attributes prevent CSRF attacks

## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login with httpOnly cookie response
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register with httpOnly cookie response
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout and clear httpOnly cookie
- `GET /api/auth/user` - Get current user using httpOnly cookie
- `POST /api/auth/refresh` - Refresh token using httpOnly cookie

## Testing Requirements

### Critical Tests Needed:

1. **Login Flow**
   - User can log in successfully
   - httpOnly cookie is set by server
   - No tokens stored in localStorage/sessionStorage

2. **Authentication Persistence**
   - User remains logged in after page refresh
   - Authentication state restored from cookie

3. **Logout Flow**
   - User can log out successfully
   - httpOnly cookie is cleared by server
   - Auth state cleared in frontend

4. **Automatic Refresh**
   - Token refresh happens every 25 minutes
   - User doesn't experience unexpected logouts
   - Failed refresh handled gracefully

5. **Multi-tab Behavior**
   - Login in one tab reflects in other tabs
   - Logout in one tab reflects in other tabs

6. **API Error Handling**
   - 401 errors properly clear auth state
   - User redirected to login when appropriate

## Known Issues to Address

1. **TypeScript Errors**: Multiple TS errors from:
   - Tests still using old auth store API
   - Missing shared type definitions
   - Component props mismatches

2. **Test Updates Needed**:
   - Update auth store tests to use new API
   - Update integration tests for cookie-based auth
   - Update MSW verification tests

3. **Component Updates**:
   - Some components may still reference old auth patterns
   - Error boundaries may need auth state updates

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] Login/logout flows working with cookies
- [ ] No tokens in browser storage
- [ ] Automatic refresh preventing logouts
- [ ] Multi-tab synchronization working
- [ ] All tests passing

## Impact

This migration addresses the critical user logout issues that have been affecting the WitchCityRope platform. Users should no longer experience unexpected logouts due to:

1. **Token expiration**: Automatic refresh prevents this
2. **Browser storage clearing**: httpOnly cookies are more persistent
3. **XSS attacks**: Tokens no longer accessible to malicious scripts
4. **Multi-tab inconsistency**: Cookie-based auth synchronizes across tabs

## Next Session Tasks

1. Fix remaining TypeScript compilation errors
2. Update unit and integration tests
3. Test the complete auth flow in browser
4. Update any remaining components using old auth patterns
5. Validate security improvements in dev tools
6. Document any additional patterns discovered
