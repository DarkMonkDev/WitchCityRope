# Dashboard "Your Upcoming Events" Fix - 2025-09-21

## Problem Identified
The "Your Upcoming Events" section on the user dashboard shows no events even when users have RSVPed to events.

## Root Cause Found
The `GetUserEventsAsync` method in `/apps/api/Features/Dashboard/Services/UserDashboardService.cs` (lines 91-92) is hardcoded to return an empty list:

```csharp
// Simplified query to avoid complex joins and computed properties
// Return empty list for now to get the endpoint working, then enhance later
var upcomingEvents = new List<DashboardEventDto>();
```

## Solution
Implement the actual query to fetch user's upcoming events from their participations (RSVPs and tickets).

## Implementation Steps
1. ✅ Identify the exact issue location and root cause
2. ✅ Implement proper query logic using EventParticipations table
3. ✅ Filter for upcoming events only (future dates)
4. ✅ Filter for active participations only
5. ✅ Map to DashboardEventDto format
6. ✅ Fix compilation errors (InstructorName field and range operator)
7. ✅ Verify build succeeds
8. ✅ Test the fix with actual data - SUCCESS!

## Test Results
✅ **Admin user** - Returns 3 upcoming class events with "Ticket Purchased" status
✅ **Vetted member** - Returns mix of class and social events with correct status:
   - Class events: "Ticket Purchased"
   - Social events: "RSVP Confirmed"
✅ **All events are future dates only**
✅ **Active participations only** (no cancelled RSVPs)
✅ **Proper confirmation codes generated**

## Fix Complete!
The "Your Upcoming Events" section will now properly display user's RSVPs and ticket purchases instead of showing empty.

## Reference
- Working participation query example: `ParticipationService.GetUserParticipationsAsync` (lines 367-386)
- Target DTO structure: `DashboardEventDto` in `UserEventsResponse.cs`
- Dashboard component expecting the data: `UpcomingEvents.tsx` (line 178)
