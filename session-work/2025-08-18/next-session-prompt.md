## Project Context: WitchCityRope React Migration

I'm continuing development on the **WitchCityRope** project, a membership and event management platform for Salem's rope bondage community. We've just completed **Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup** and are ready to begin **Phase 2: Feature Migration**.

### Current State: Infrastructure COMPLETE ✅

**Major Milestone Achieved**: Mantine v7 form infrastructure is fully validated and working

#### What's Already Working:
- ✅ **Form Components Test Page**: Fully functional at `/mantine-forms` route
- ✅ **Enhanced Mantine Components**: TextInput, PasswordInput, Textarea, Select with floating labels
- ✅ **CSS-Only Placeholder Solution**: Complex Mantine v7 placeholder visibility control solved
- ✅ **Floating Label Implementation**: Consistent positioning with tapered underline effects
- ✅ **CSS Architecture**: Modules with PostCSS preset processing Mantine styles
- ✅ **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety with enhanced component interfaces
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Mantine form + Zod validation patterns operational

#### Technology Stack Confirmed:
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 + TypeScript + Vite + **Mantine v7** (validated)
- **Forms**: Mantine use-form + Zod validation (working patterns established)
- **Styling**: CSS Modules + PostCSS preset + Mantine variables (fully functional)
- **Backend**: .NET 9 API + PostgreSQL (stable, no changes needed)
- **Authentication**: httpOnly cookies (proven architecture)

### Available Infrastructure:

#### Enhanced Form Components (Ready to Use):
- **MantineTextInput**: `/apps/web/src/components/forms/MantineFormInputs.tsx`
- **MantinePasswordInput**: With strength meter and visibility toggle
- **MantineTextarea**: With auto-resize and consistent positioning
- **MantineSelect**: With floating labels and enhanced styling

#### CSS Patterns Established:
- **Centralized CSS Module**: `/apps/web/src/styles/FormComponents.module.css`
- **Mantine CSS Variables**: Access to framework theming system
- **Floating Labels**: Consistent positioning regardless of helper text
- **Placeholder Control**: CSS-only solution for visibility management

#### Form Validation Patterns:
```typescript
// Proven pattern ready for use
const form = useForm({
  initialValues: { email: '', password: '' },
  validate: zodResolver(validationSchema),
});

<MantineTextInput
  {...form.getInputProps('email')}
  floatingLabel
  taperedUnderline
  placeholder="Enter your email"
  required
/>
```

### Next Phase Objectives: Feature Migration

**Phase 2 Goal**: Migrate core features from Blazor to React using proven Mantine v7 infrastructure

#### Recommended Priority Order:
1. **Authentication Flows** (login, register, logout) - Use established form patterns
2. **User Dashboard** (profile management, account settings) - Test data display patterns
3. **Event Management** (registration, listing, details) - Complex forms and business logic
4. **Admin Interface** (user management, event administration) - Advanced UI patterns

### Technical Patterns Established:

#### Enhanced Component Usage:
```typescript
// All these patterns are working and ready to use
<MantineTextInput 
  floatingLabel 
  taperedUnderline 
  placeholder="Username or email" 
/>

<MantinePasswordInput 
  floatingLabel 
  strengthMeter 
  placeholder="Password" 
/>
```

#### CSS Module Integration:
```css
/* Proven patterns in FormComponents.module.css */
.mantineInput {
  /* Access Mantine variables */
  --input-bd: light-dark(var(--mantine-color-gray-4), var(--mantine-color-dark-4));
}

/* Override Mantine styles with specificity */
.mantineInput input:not(:focus):placeholder-shown::placeholder {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

### Key Documentation Available:

#### Implementation References:
- **Working Example**: Visit `/mantine-forms` to see all components in action
- **Component Library**: `/apps/web/src/components/forms/MantineFormInputs.tsx`
- **CSS Patterns**: `/apps/web/src/styles/FormComponents.module.css`
- **Research Documentation**: `/docs/functional-areas/forms-standardization/research/`

#### Process Documentation:
- **Forms Standardization**: `/docs/standards-processes/forms-standardization.md` (updated with implementation)
- **Session Handoff**: `/docs/standards-processes/session-handoffs/2025-08-18-form-infrastructure-handoff.md`
- **Migration Plan**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/migration-plan.md` (Phase 1 complete)

### Recommended First Action:

Use this orchestrate command to begin authentication feature migration:

```
/orchestrate Migrate the authentication flows (login, register, logout) to use the new Mantine v7 form components. Use the proven form patterns from /mantine-forms test page. Implement the authentication pages with floating labels, validation, and WitchCityRope branding. Follow the 5-phase workflow with business requirements, UI design, implementation, testing, and finalization.
```

#### Expected Workflow:
- **Phase 1**: Business requirements for authentication flows
- **Phase 2**: UI design using established Mantine component patterns  
- **Phase 3**: Implementation with proven form components and CSS modules
- **Phase 4**: Testing with form validation and user experience validation
- **Phase 5**: Code formatting, documentation, and lessons learned capture

### Key Success Factors:

#### Use Established Patterns:
- Start with working components from `/apps/web/src/components/forms/`
- Reference `/mantine-forms` test page for component usage examples
- Apply CSS module patterns from `FormComponents.module.css`
- Use Mantine form + Zod validation for all forms

#### Development Advantages:
- **Fast Iteration**: Hot reload development experience optimized
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript coverage maintained
- **Consistent UI**: Component library with WitchCityRope branding
- **Proven Solutions**: CSS specificity and placeholder control issues already solved

#### Risk Mitigation:
- All major technical challenges solved during infrastructure phase
- Component patterns established and validated
- CSS architecture scalable and maintainable
- Form validation patterns proven with working examples

### Project Health Status:

#### Build Status: ✅ EXCELLENT
- React app builds successfully with Mantine v7
- TypeScript compilation clean with no errors
- CSS processing working correctly with PostCSS preset
- Hot reload fast and reliable
- All dependencies functional

#### Development Readiness: ✅ EXCEPTIONAL
- Infrastructure 100% validated and working  
- Component patterns established and reusable
- CSS architecture scalable for additional features
- Development workflow optimized for productivity
- Documentation comprehensive and current

### Confidence Level: **EXCEPTIONAL (98%+)**

**Ready to proceed immediately with feature migration using validated technology stack and proven component patterns.**

---

**Action**: Begin with the authentication flow migration orchestrate command above, or choose a different feature to migrate using the established Mantine v7 infrastructure.

**Current Working Directory**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react`

**Quick Validation**: Visit `http://localhost:5173/mantine-forms` after starting the dev server to see all working form components.

**Development Start Command**: `npm run dev` (if not already running)
