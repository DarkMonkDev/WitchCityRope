# Temporary Test Files Cleanup Summary

**Date**: September 22, 2025
**Session**: Event Management Development Completion Cleanup
**Context**: Comprehensive event management fixes completed in commit `eacf997`

## Files Cleaned Up

### Root Directory Test Files - DELETED
These files were temporary debugging scripts created during development sessions:

1. **test-login.js** - Simple bcrypt password verification test
2. **test-authentication-flow.js** - Playwright-based authentication flow testing
3. **test-port-configuration.js** - Port connectivity and API endpoint verification
4. **test-ui-api-communication.js** - Communication testing between frontend and backend
5. **test-login2.js** - Additional login verification testing

**Reason for Deletion**: All authentication and communication issues have been resolved. Event management system is fully functional as confirmed by commit `eacf997`.

### Scripts Directory Test Files - EVALUATED

#### Kept in `/session-work/2025-09-22/` (Potentially Useful)
- **test-events-api.js** - API response structure testing (moved from scripts/debug/)
- **test-admin-events-fix.js** - Admin events debugging (moved from scripts/debug/)
- **test-teacher-selection-fix.js** - Teacher selection debugging (moved from scripts/debug/)

#### Deleted (Obsolete)
- **test-demo-fixes.js** - Demo page testing for Event Session Matrix (no longer relevant)

## Cleanup Actions Performed

1. **Deleted Root Directory Test Files**: Removed all 5 temporary test files from project root
2. **Moved Useful Scripts**: Preserved potentially useful debugging scripts in session-work
3. **Deleted Obsolete Scripts**: Removed demo testing script that's no longer relevant
4. **Updated File Registry**: Logged all deletions and moves with proper metadata

## Impact

- **Project Root Cleanliness**: Restored proper project structure with no temporary files
- **Information Preservation**: Kept potentially useful debugging scripts in session-work
- **File Registry Compliance**: All operations properly logged for traceability

## Development State

With these cleanups, the project is now in a clean state following the completion of:
- Event management UI/UX improvements
- Data display fixes for participation and tickets
- Button styling and React rendering issue resolution
- Backend API enhancement for proper data structure

All temporary debugging artifacts from this development phase have been properly cleaned up.

## Verification Results

**Root Directory**: ✅ Clean (0 test files remaining)
**Scripts Directory**: ✅ Clean (0 test files remaining)
**Session Work**: ✅ 3 useful scripts preserved
**File Registry**: ✅ All 13 operations logged

## Commands Used for Verification

```bash
# Verify root cleanup
ls -la /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/test-*.js
# Result: No test files found in root directory (cleanup successful)

# Verify scripts cleanup
ls -la /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/scripts/debug/test-*.js
# Result: No test files found in scripts/debug directory (cleanup successful)

# Verify preservation
ls -la /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/session-work/2025-09-22/
# Result: 3 test scripts preserved + cleanup documentation
```

## Next Steps

With this cleanup complete:
1. **Project Ready**: Clean structure for future development work
2. **Documentation Current**: File registry accurately reflects project state
3. **Knowledge Preserved**: Useful debugging scripts available in session-work if needed
4. **Standards Maintained**: Proper librarian cleanup procedures followed

The project is now in optimal state following the comprehensive event management improvements committed in `eacf997`.
