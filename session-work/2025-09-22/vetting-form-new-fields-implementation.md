# Vetting Form New Fields Implementation - September 22, 2025

## Summary
Successfully added two new optional fields to the vetting application form:
1. **Pronouns field** (after Real Name)
2. **Other Names field** (after FetLife Handle)

## Changes Made

### 1. TypeScript Types Updated
**File**: `/apps/web/src/features/vetting/types/simplified-vetting.types.ts`

Added to `SimplifiedApplicationFormData`:
- `pronouns?: string` - Optional field for user pronouns
- `otherNames?: string` - Optional field for other names/handles

Added to `SimplifiedCreateApplicationRequest`:
- `pronouns?: string` - Maps to API request
- `otherNames?: string` - Maps to API request

### 2. Zod Validation Schema Updated
**File**: `/apps/web/src/features/vetting/schemas/simplifiedApplicationSchema.ts`

Added validation rules:
```typescript
pronouns: z.string()
  .max(50, 'Pronouns must be less than 50 characters')
  .optional()
  .or(z.literal('')), // Allow empty string

otherNames: z.string()
  .max(500, 'Other names must be less than 500 characters')
  .optional()
  .or(z.literal('')), // Allow empty string
```

Updated default form values and field validation messages.

### 3. Form Component Updated
**File**: `/apps/web/src/features/vetting/components/VettingApplicationForm.tsx`

#### Added Pronouns Field (after Real Name):
- Label: "Pronouns"
- Placeholder: "Enter your pronouns (optional)"
- Description: "How you'd like to be referred to (e.g., she/her, they/them)"
- Uses `EnhancedTextInput` component
- Max 50 characters

#### Added Other Names Field (after FetLife Handle):
- Label: "Other Names or Handles"
- Placeholder: "List any other names, nicknames, or social media handles (optional)"
- Description: "Any other names, nicknames, or social media handles you have used in a kinky context"
- Uses `EnhancedTextarea` component (2-4 lines)
- Max 500 characters

#### Updated Form Submission:
- Added `pronouns: formData.pronouns || undefined` to API request
- Added `otherNames: formData.otherNames || undefined` to API request

#### Updated Preview List:
- Added "Your pronouns (optional)" to the preview list

## API Integration

The fields are properly integrated with the backend API:
- Form data is mapped to the API request structure
- Optional fields are sent as `undefined` if empty
- Backend API expects these fields and they are already implemented

## Validation

Both fields have proper client-side validation:
- Character limits enforced
- Optional field handling with empty string support
- Consistent error messages
- Form validates successfully with new fields

## UI/UX Considerations

- Fields follow the established floating label pattern
- Consistent styling with existing form fields
- Clear descriptions explaining the purpose of each field
- Proper field ordering as requested
- Responsive design maintained

## Testing Status

- ✅ Development server compiles without errors
- ✅ TypeScript types validate correctly
- ✅ Form renders with new fields in correct positions
- ✅ Zod validation schema works correctly
- ✅ API integration properly maps field data

## Notes

- Backend API was already updated to handle these fields
- Fields are properly encrypted on the backend (based on existing pattern)
- Implementation follows established project patterns
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Maintains consistent user experience
