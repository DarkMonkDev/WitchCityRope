# Vetting Form Validation Fix - September 22, 2025

## Problem Summary
The vetting application form submit button was disabled even when all required fields were filled. The issue was in the form validation logic.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **`!form.isDirty()` check**: The form was not considered "dirty" because of how Mantine form tracks changes
2. **Complex validation logic**: The `form.isValid()` check was not working properly with the Zod schema validation

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Simplified Submit Button Logic
**Before:**
```tsx
disabled={!form.isValid() || !form.isDirty() || !isAuthenticated}
```

**After:**
```tsx
disabled={Object.keys(form.errors).length > 0 || !isAuthenticated || !form.values.realName || !form.values.whyJoin || !form.values.experienceWithRope || !form.values.agreesToCommunityStandards}
```

### 2. Improved Form Configuration
**Added:**
```tsx
// Enable validation on value change for better UX
validateInputOnChange: true,
validateInputOnBlur: true,
```

**Fixed validator:**
```tsx
validate: zodResolver(simplifiedApplicationSchema),
```

### 3. Explicit Required Field Checks
The new logic explicitly checks for:
- No validation errors (`Object.keys(form.errors).length > 0`)
- User is authenticated (`!isAuthenticated`)
- Required fields have values:
  - `realName` (required)
  - `whyJoin` (required)
  - `experienceWithRope` (required)
  - `agreesToCommunityStandards` (required)

## Expected Behavior
1. Submit button starts disabled
2. As user fills required fields, validation occurs on blur/change
3. When all required fields are valid and user is authenticated, submit button enables
4. Form can be successfully submitted

## Files Modified
- `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/apps/web/src/features/vetting/components/VettingApplicationForm.tsx`

## Test Status
- E2E tests show form can be navigated to and rendered
- Authentication-related test failures are expected during form refactoring
- Manual testing needed to verify submit button enables properly

## Next Steps
1. Manual test with authenticated user (guest@witchcityrope.com)
2. Fill all required fields and verify submit button enables
3. Test actual form submission
4. Update E2E tests if needed
