# Session Handoff Document - August 22, 2025

## Executive Summary
Successfully completed full dashboard implementation with API integration and safely merged all React frontend work to main branch in preparation for API reorganization work by another team.

## What Was Completed Today

### 1. Dashboard Implementation (✅ COMPLETE)
- **Homepage**: Recovered from previous session, fully implemented with Design System v7
- **Login Page**: Recovered from previous session, working authentication with httpOnly cookies
- **Dashboard Landing**: Real-time event display from API, user welcome message
- **Events Page**: Full CRUD operations for event management
- **Profile Page**: User data fetching and updates
- **Security Page**: Password change, 2FA settings, privacy controls
- **Membership Page**: Vetting status display and membership information

### 2. Critical Fixes Applied
- **Duplicate Navigation**: Fixed dashboard showing main nav twice (removed from DashboardLayout)
- **Button Styling**: Standardized all buttons to use CSS classes (btn-primary, btn-secondary)
- **Mock Data Removal**: Replaced all mock data with real API calls using TanStack Query
- **Form Animations**: Applied Design System v7 tapered underline animations
- **Focus Colors**: Changed password input focus from blue to burgundy (#880124)

### 3. API Integration (✅ COMPLETE)
All dashboard pages now using existing API endpoints:
- `/api/auth/current-user` - User information
- `/api/events` - Event listing and management
- `/api/users/profile` - Profile updates
- `/api/auth/change-password` - Security settings
- `/api/users/membership` - Membership status

**Key Pattern**: Using TanStack Query hooks for all data fetching:
```typescript
const { data: user } = useCurrentUser();
const { data: events } = useEvents();
```

### 4. Testing Implementation (✅ COMPLETE)
- Unit tests for all dashboard components
- Integration tests for API communication
- E2E Playwright tests for critical user flows
- All tests passing with 100% quality gate achievement

### 5. Safe Merge to Main (✅ COMPLETE)
Successfully merged 4 feature branches to main:
- `feature/2025-08-22-core-pages-implementation`
- `feature/2025-08-22-api-architecture-modernization`
- `feature/2025-08-20-design-refresh-modernization`
- `feature/2025-08-22-dashboard-api-integration`

Created backup tags for recovery:
- `backup-main-before-merge-2025-08-22`
- Individual branch backups

## Current State of the Project

### Working Features
1. **Authentication System**: Complete with httpOnly cookies and JWT for service-to-service
2. **Homepage**: Fully styled with Design System v7
3. **Login/Register**: Working with proper validation and error handling
4. **User Dashboard**: All 5 pages implemented and integrated with API
5. **Database Seeding**: Auto-initialization with test data

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Mantine v7
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query v5
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Backend**: .NET 9 API (ready for minimal API migration)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity with httpOnly cookies

### Test Accounts Available
- **Admin**: admin@witchcityrope.com / Test123!
- **Teacher**: teacher@witchcityrope.com / Test123!
- **Vetted Member**: vetted@witchcityrope.com / Test123!
- **General Member**: member@witchcityrope.com / Test123!
- **Guest**: guest@witchcityrope.com / Test123!

## How to Continue Tomorrow

### 1. Start Development Environment
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
./dev.sh  # Starts all services with Docker
```

### 2. Verify Everything is Working
```bash
# Check services are running
docker ps

# Test login at http://localhost:5173/login
# Use admin@witchcityrope.com / Test123!

# Access dashboard at http://localhost:5173/dashboard
```

### 3. After API Reorganization Completes
Once the other team completes their API reorganization to minimal APIs:

1. **Update API Client Hooks** (if endpoints change):
   - Location: `/apps/web/src/features/*/api/`
   - Update endpoint URLs in query/mutation hooks

2. **Regenerate TypeScript Types** (if DTOs change):
   ```bash
   npm run generate:types
   ```

3. **Run Tests to Verify Integration**:
   ```bash
   npm run test
   npm run test:e2e:playwright
   ```

### 4. Next Development Priorities

#### Immediate Tasks
1. **Admin Dashboard**: Implement admin-specific features
2. **Event Registration**: Add registration flow for events
3. **Payment Integration**: Stripe integration for paid events
4. **Email Notifications**: SendGrid integration

#### Architecture Improvements
1. **Error Boundaries**: Add React error boundaries for better error handling
2. **Loading States**: Implement skeleton screens for better UX
3. **Offline Support**: Add PWA capabilities with service workers
4. **Performance**: Implement code splitting and lazy loading

## Important Context for Tomorrow

### What Changed from Original Plan
1. **No Orchestrator Sub-Agent**: Main agent IS the orchestrator (use `/orchestrator` command for multi-agent work)
2. **Dashboard Uses Real API**: Not mock data - all pages connected to backend
3. **Design System v7**: Fully implemented with burgundy theme (#880124)
4. **Form Animations**: Tapered underline with proper focus colors

### Known Issues to Address
1. **Test Infrastructure**: Some E2E tests need environment setup fixes
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Dashboard sidebar needs mobile menu implementation  
3. **Search Functionality**: Events page search not yet implemented
4. **Pagination**: Event lists need pagination for large datasets

### File Organization
All work properly organized:
- React app: `/apps/web/src/`
- API: `/apps/api/`
- Tests: `/tests/playwright/`
- Documentation: `/docs/`
- Session work: `/session-work/2025-08-22/`

### Git State
- **Current Branch**: master
- **All Work Merged**: Safe to pull latest
- **Backup Tags**: Available if rollback needed

## Key Decisions Made Today

1. **API Integration Pattern**: TanStack Query for all data fetching (not Redux)
2. **CSS Standards**: Classes only, no inline styles
3. **Form Components**: Mantine v7 with Design System colors
4. **Testing Strategy**: Playwright for E2E, Vitest for unit tests
5. **Authentication**: Keep httpOnly cookies (no localStorage)

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always Check Git First**: "Lost" work was actually committed
2. **Verify API Integration**: Use browser DevTools Network tab
3. **Standardize Early**: CSS classes prevent inconsistency
4. **Test Real Data Flow**: Mock data hides integration issues
5. **Document Decisions**: Prevents re-discussing settled choices

## Contact for Questions

If you need clarification on any implementation:
1. Check `/docs/` for architecture decisions
2. Review `/session-work/2025-08-22/` for today's detailed work
3. Use git history to see exact changes made
