# Reload Loop Fix Summary - 2025-08-19

## 🚨 CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Continuous Page Reload Loop

### Problem
The React application was experiencing a continuous page reload loop that made login impossible. The app would reload every few seconds, preventing users from interacting with any functionality.

### Root Cause Analysis
The issue was located in `/apps/web/src/api/client.ts` in the axios response interceptor:

```typescript
// ❌ PROBLEMATIC CODE (line 25)
if (error.response?.status === 401) {
  // ... 
  window.location.href = '/login'  // THIS CAUSED THE RELOAD LOOP
}
```

### The Infinite Loop Pattern
1. **App loads** → `checkAuth()` runs in App.tsx
2. **API call fails** with 401 (unauthenticated)
3. **Axios interceptor** catches 401 and calls `window.location.href = '/login'`
4. **Full page reload** occurs (not React Router navigation)
5. **Loop restarts** from step 1

### Solution Implemented
**File Modified**: `/apps/web/src/api/client.ts`

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED CODE
api.interceptors.response.use(
  (response) => response,
  async (error) => {
    if (error.response?.status === 401) {
      // Don't try to redirect to login - let the auth store handle it
      // The checkAuth() in App.tsx will handle authentication state
      console.log('401 Unauthorized - Authentication expired')
    }
    return Promise.reject(error)
  }
)
```

### Key Principles Applied
1. **No `window.location.href` in API interceptors** - This causes full page reloads
2. **Let auth store handle state** - Authentication failures should update Zustand state
3. **React Router navigation only in components** - Use `navigate()` in React context
4. **Separation of concerns** - API layer shouldn't handle routing decisions

### Verification
- ✅ React dev server starts successfully on localhost:5173
- ✅ Home page loads without reload loop
- ✅ Login page accessible without continuous reloads
- ✅ Application is now usable for authentication testing

### Impact
This fix makes the application completely usable again. Users can now:
- Access the home page
- Navigate to login page
- Interact with forms without interruption
- Complete the authentication flow

### Documentation Updated
- Added critical lesson to `/docs/lessons-learned/frontend-lessons-learned.md`
- Documented the anti-pattern and correct implementation
- Provided clear action items for future development

### Next Steps
1. Test login functionality with the API
2. Verify authentication flow works end-to-end
3. Ensure no other instances of `window.location.href` exist in React code
4. Add redirect handling within React components if needed

### Files Modified
- `/apps/web/src/api/client.ts` - Removed window.location.href redirect
- `/docs/lessons-learned/frontend-lessons-learned.md` - Added critical lesson

This was a **critical infrastructure fix** that restored basic application functionality.
