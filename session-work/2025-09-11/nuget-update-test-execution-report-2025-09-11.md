# NuGet Package Update Test Execution Report

**Date:** 2025-09-11  
**Test Executor:** test-executor  
**Context:** Post-NuGet package update verification  

## Executive Summary

❌ **CRITICAL BUILD FAILURES DETECTED**
- 21 compilation errors found after NuGet package updates
- All errors are related to missing properties/methods on core entity classes
- API compilation completely fails - cannot proceed with runtime testing
- **Status:** FAILED - Requires immediate backend-developer intervention

## Environment Status

### ✅ Pre-Flight Checks (PASSED)
- Docker containers: `witchcity-api` (healthy), `witchcity-postgres` (healthy)
- Basic health endpoint: `http://localhost:5655/health` returns `{"status":"Healthy"}`
- Swagger documentation: Available at `http://localhost:5655/swagger/index.html`
- Container logs: No errors detected

### ❌ Compilation Tests (FAILED)

**Clean build results:**
- **Errors:** 21
- **Warnings:** 136
- **Build Status:** FAILED

## Critical Error Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing Entity Properties/Methods

The NuGet package updates appear to have caused Entity Framework Core model changes that broke existing code. All errors are concentrated in `EventService.cs` and related to missing properties on entity classes:

#### EventSession Entity Issues:
- Missing `IsActive` property (used in lines 793, 858)

#### EventTicketType Entity Issues:
- Missing `AddSessionInclusion()` method (line 829)
- Missing `Registrations` property (line 921)
- Missing `SessionInclusions` property (lines 946, 968)
- Missing `TicketType` property (line 979)
- Missing `SalesEndDateTime` property (line 983)
- Missing `GetAvailableQuantity()` method (line 988)
- Missing `AreSalesOpen()` method (line 989)

#### Other Issues:
- Type conversion error: Cannot convert `TicketTypeEnum` to `string` (line 819)

## Error Pattern Classification

| Error Type | Count | Suggested Agent | Priority |
|------------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Missing Properties | 15 | backend-developer | CRITICAL |
| Missing Methods | 4 | backend-developer | CRITICAL |
| Type Conversion | 2 | backend-developer | CRITICAL |

## Root Cause Analysis

This appears to be a **Entity Framework Core migration issue**. The NuGet package updates likely included:
1. EF Core version changes that modified entity model requirements
2. Breaking changes in domain model structure
3. Missing EF migrations for new schema requirements

## Failed Test Phases

- ✅ **Phase 1:** Environment Pre-Flight Checks - PASSED
- ❌ **Phase 2:** Compilation Tests - FAILED (Cannot proceed)
- ⏸️ **Phase 3:** Unit Tests - SKIPPED (Compilation failed)
- ⏸️ **Phase 4:** Integration Tests - SKIPPED (Compilation failed)  
- ⏸️ **Phase 5:** E2E Tests - SKIPPED (Compilation failed)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **backend-developer** must review and fix all compilation errors
2. Review EF Core migration strategy for NuGet package updates
3. Update entity models to match current schema requirements
4. Add missing properties/methods to entity classes

### Next Steps:
1. Once compilation issues are fixed, re-run full test suite
2. Verify no runtime breaking changes
3. Test authentication and CRUD operations
4. Run full E2E test suite

## Test Artifacts

- Full build output captured in this report
- No runtime artifacts generated (compilation failed)
- Container logs show healthy state pre-compilation

## Conclusion

The NuGet package updates have introduced significant breaking changes to the Entity Framework Core domain models. **All development work must be blocked until these 21 compilation errors are resolved by the backend-developer.**

The infrastructure (Docker, database, basic services) remains healthy, indicating this is purely a code compatibility issue introduced by the package updates.
