# Send Reminder Button Fix - Wireframe Compliance

## Problem Fixed
The Send Reminder button was incorrectly disabled when no rows were selected, and the modal only worked with pre-selected applications. This didn't match the approved wireframes.

## Wireframe Requirement
According to `/docs/functional-areas/vetting-system/What it should look like.png`, the "SEND REMINDER" button should:
- Always be enabled (not dependent on row selection)
- Allow users to select applications INSIDE the modal
- Work independently of the table row selection state

## Changes Made

### 1. AdminVettingPage.tsx
- **Removed disabled condition** from Send Reminder button
- **Removed selection count** from button text (now just "SEND REMINDER")
- **Updated modal rendering** to not require selected applications
- **Separated modal logic** - Put on Hold still requires selections, Send Reminder works independently

### 2. SendReminderModal.tsx (Complete Rewrite)
- **Added application selection UI** with checkboxes inside the modal
- **Implemented Select All functionality** for batch operations
- **Added scrollable application list** with proper display (Name, Status, Application Number)
- **Maintained backwards compatibility** for legacy single/bulk application passing
- **Enhanced validation** to require at least one application selection
- **Updated button text** to show count of selected applications
- **Improved user experience** with clear instructions and visual feedback

## New Modal Features
- **Application Selection Area**: Scrollable list with checkboxes
- **Select All Checkbox**: Bulk selection with indeterminate state
- **Application Info Display**: Shows name, status, and application number
- **Dynamic Submit Button**: Shows count of selected applications
- **Validation**: Prevents submission without selections
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Still works with legacy props if passed

## User Experience Improvements
1. **Always Available**: Send Reminder button is always clickable
2. **Clear Selection**: Users can see exactly which applications they're sending reminders to
3. **Flexible Workflow**: No need to pre-select rows in the table
4. **Better Feedback**: Clear error messages and success notifications
5. **Efficient Bulk Operations**: Easy to select multiple applications at once

## Technical Implementation
- Uses existing `useVettingApplications` hook to fetch available applications
- Filters to show only statuses that typically need reminders
- Maintains state separation between table selections and modal selections
- Preserves all existing API integration patterns
- Follows established Mantine UI patterns and styling

This fix brings the Send Reminder functionality into full compliance with the approved wireframes while maintaining all existing functionality and improving the user experience.
