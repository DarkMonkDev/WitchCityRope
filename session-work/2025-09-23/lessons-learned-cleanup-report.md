- Line 702-703: "SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION" and "Achievement" entries
- Line 874-875: "SUCCESSFUL PROCESS" and "Achievement" entries
- Line 1048: "SUCCESS: Missing API Endpoints Implementation"
- Line 1192: "SUCCESS: Vetting Audit Log History Implementation"

### 2. test-developer-lessons-learned.md
**Violations Found**:
- Line 974: "TRANSFORMATIONAL SUCCESS - September 2025"

- Line 1824: "Key Success Patterns"

### 3. librarian-lessons-learned.md

### 4. Other Files with Violations
- database-designer-lessons-learned.md

- orchestrator-lessons-learned.md
- react-developer-lessons-learned-2.md
- react-developer-lessons-learned-part-2.md
- technology-researcher-lessons-learned.md
- test-executor-lessons-learned.md

## Key Problems Identified

### 1. Status Reports Being Added
Files contain project status updates like "Successfully completed X" instead of prevention patterns.

### 2. Achievement Celebrations
Multiple "MAJOR SUCCESS" and "ACHIEVEMENT" entries celebrating completions rather than documenting mistakes to avoid.

### 3. Implementation Details
Long implementation guides and code examples exceeding 3 lines instead of concise problem/solution pairs.

### 4. Project History
Timeline-based entries ("On 2025-09-22 we did X") instead of timeless prevention patterns.

## Recommended Actions

### 1. Update Size Limit Documentation
- Update LESSONS-LEARNED-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md to reflect 1700 line limit
- Clarify that multi-part files can each be up to 1700 lines

### 2. Content Cleanup Required
All violations should be rewritten as prevention patterns:
- Convert SUCCESS stories → Problem/Solution patterns
- Remove achievement celebrations → Document what to avoid
- Trim implementation details → Maximum 3 line code examples
- Remove project history → Focus on prevention patterns only

### 3. Template Enforcement
Each file should follow LESSONS-LEARNED-TEMPLATE.md format:
- Problem: [1 sentence - what went wrong]
- Solution: [1 sentence - how to prevent it]

## Files Exceeding Size Limits (>1700 lines)
- test-developer-lessons-learned.md: 2172 lines (needs split or trimming)

## Delegation Requirements for Librarian

The librarian agent should:
1. Clean up all SUCCESS/ACHIEVEMENT entries in identified files
2. Convert status reports to prevention patterns
3. Ensure all files follow the template format
4. Split test-developer-lessons-learned.md if needed (>1700 lines)
5. Update LESSONS-LEARNED-VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md with correct size limit (1700 lines)

## Impact Assessment
These violations are causing:
- Bloated files that are harder to scan quickly
- Confusion about what belongs in lessons learned
- Status information mixed with prevention patterns
- Agents potentially learning wrong patterns from celebration entries
