## Technical Implementation

### Conditional Creation Pattern
```csharp
// Application 10: RopeBunny - Someone new to rope looking to learn
if (users.Count >= 10)
{
    additionalApplications.Add(new VettingApplication
    {
        // ... application details
        Status = VettingStatus.UnderReview,
        SubmittedAt = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(-2),
        AdminNotes = null
    });
}
```

### Key Features
- Proper user constraint checking (only creates if enough users exist)
- Realistic submission timing (recent applications)
- Comprehensive application text demonstrating different experience levels
- Proper email format validation
- Diverse pronoun representation

## Files Modified
- `/apps/api/Services/SeedDataService.cs` - Added applications 10 and 11
- `/docs/lessons-learned/backend-developer-lessons-learned.md` - Documented enhancement

## Testing Ready
The enhanced seed data provides:
- More UnderReview applications for testing the full workflow from beginning
- Variety of experience levels for realistic testing scenarios
- All required email addresses for email validation testing
- Sufficient applications for pagination and filtering testing

## Next Steps
After this enhancement, the Docker container will need to rebuild to apply the new seed data. The vetting system now has comprehensive test data covering all workflow states from complete beginners to experienced practitioners.
