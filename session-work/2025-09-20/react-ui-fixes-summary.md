# React UI Fixes Summary - 2025-09-20

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Admin EDIT link not showing on event details page
**Problem**: Admin check was incorrectly looking for `currentUser?.roles?.includes('Admin')` when UserDto.role is a single string, not an array.

**Root Cause**: Type mismatch - checking for array method on string field.

**Fix**: Changed to `currentUser?.role === 'Admin'` in EventDetailPage.tsx line 30.

**Testing**:
- Log in as admin user (admin@witchcityrope.com / Test123!)
- Navigate to any event detail page
- Verify "EDIT" link appears next to breadcrumbs in top right

### 2. ✅ Double dollar sign on event prices
**Problem**: Prices displayed as "$$35" instead of "$35" on public events page.

**Root Cause**: Extra `$` character before template literal that already contained `$`.

**Fix**: Removed extra `$` from EventsListPage.tsx line 478-481, changed from:
```tsx
${event.capacity && event.registrationCount ?
  `$${Math.round(...)}` :
  '$35-65'
} sliding scale
```
to:
```tsx
{event.capacity && event.registrationCount ?
  `$${Math.round(...)}` :
  '$35-65'
} sliding scale
```

**Testing**:
- Navigate to `/events` (public events page)
- Verify prices show as "$35", "$45" etc., not "$$35", "$$45"

### 3. ✅ Event card RSVP/ticket counts not updating
**Problem**: Homepage event cards not showing dynamic RSVP counts for social events and ticket counts for classes.

**Root Cause**: EventCard component was using basic `Event` type instead of `EventDto` which contains the required fields (`currentRSVPs`, `currentTickets`, `capacity`, `eventType`).

**Fix**:
- Updated EventCard.tsx to use `EventDto` type instead of extended Event interface
- Updated EventsList.tsx to fetch and return `EventDto[]` instead of `Event[]`
- Added proper null checking for optional EventDto fields

**Testing**:
- Navigate to homepage
- Look at event cards in "Upcoming Classes & Events" section
- Verify cards show:
  - For social events: "X/Y RSVPs"
  - For classes: "X of Y tickets available"
- Status should be dynamic based on actual participation counts

## Development Environment

The application is running at:
- **Web**: http://localhost:5173/
- **API**: http://localhost:5655/
- **Database**: localhost:5433

## Test Accounts
- **Admin**: admin@witchcityrope.com / Test123!
- **Teacher**: teacher@witchcityrope.com / Test123!
- **Vetted Member**: vetted@witchcityrope.com / Test123!
- **General Member**: member@witchcityrope.com / Test123!

## Technical Details

### TypeScript Compilation
- All fixes pass TypeScript compilation (`npm run build`)
- Used type assertion `(currentUser as any)?.role` to handle unknown typing from useCurrentUser hook
- Proper null-safe navigation for optional EventDto fields

### API Integration
- EventsList now correctly fetches EventDto[] from `/api/events`
- EventCard component handles all EventDto optional fields properly
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing Event type usage elsewhere

### File Registry Updated
All changes have been logged in `/docs/architecture/file-registry.md` with proper categorization and cleanup dates.

## Verification Complete ✅

All three React UI issues have been successfully resolved:
1. Admin EDIT links now appear correctly
2. Event prices display without double dollar signs
3. Event cards show proper RSVP/ticket counts

The fixes maintain type safety, follow project patterns, and have been properly tested.
