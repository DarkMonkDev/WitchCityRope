# Test Migration Comparison Report

**Date:** $(date)

**Mode:** $([ "$HEADED" == "true" ] && echo "headed" || echo "headless")
**Base URL:** $BASE_URL

## Summary

### Puppeteer Results
\`\`\`
$(cat "$COMPARISON_DIR/puppeteer/summary.txt" 2>/dev/null || echo "No results available")
\`\`\`

### Playwright Results
\`\`\`
$(cat "$COMPARISON_DIR/playwright/summary.txt" 2>/dev/null || echo "No results available")
\`\`\`

## Detailed Logs

- Puppeteer output: [puppeteer/output.log](puppeteer/output.log)
- Playwright output: [playwright/output.log](playwright/output.log)
- Playwright JSON results: [playwright/results.json](playwright/results.json)

## Migration Notes

### Advantages observed with Playwright:
- Better error messages and debugging information
- Built-in test retry mechanism
- Native TypeScript support
- Better parallel execution
- More comprehensive reporting options

### Migration considerations:
- Update selectors to use Playwright's more robust locator strategies
- Leverage Playwright's auto-waiting features
- Use page fixtures for better test isolation
- Consider using Playwright's built-in assertions

## Next Steps

1. Review failed tests in both frameworks
2. Update Playwright tests to match Puppeteer functionality
3. Gradually migrate remaining Puppeteer tests
4. Remove Puppeteer dependencies once migration is complete
