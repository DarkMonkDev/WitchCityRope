# WitchCityRope Project Cleanup Summary

**Date:** July 21, 2025  

## Safety Measures

1. **Conservative Approach:** When uncertain, files were moved to `ToBeDeleted/` rather than deleted

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions:**
- Review `ToBeDeleted/` folder contents when convenient  
- Delete `ToBeDeleted/` folder after confirming no needed files
- Consider adding `.gitignore` entries to prevent future screenshot accumulation

### **Future Prevention:**
- Configure test scripts to save artifacts in `/temp/` or organized folders
- Regular cleanup of test screenshots and debug files
- Use organized test directories for new development

## Files Available for Review

**Cleanup Folder:** `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/WitchCityRope/ToBeDeleted/`
- Contains all questionable files for manual review
- Safe to delete after verification
