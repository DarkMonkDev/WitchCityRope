# Login Functionality Test Report

## Test Environment
- URL: http://localhost:5651
- Test Date: 2025-07-06
- Test Credentials:
  - Email: admin@witchcityrope.com
  - Password: Test123!

## Test Results

### 1. Initial Navigation Check
✓ Server is running and responding at http://localhost:5651
✓ Initial navigation menu found with the following elements:
- Events & Classes
- How To Join
- Resources
- LOGIN button (visible in both desktop and mobile nav)

### 2. Login Page Discovery
✓ Login endpoint found at: http://localhost:5651/login
✓ Login page responds with HTTP 200 status

### 3. Login Form Analysis
⚠ The login form structure could not be fully analyzed via curl
- Direct POST to /login with JSON payload returned 400 Bad Request
- This suggests the login might use:
  - Form-encoded data instead of JSON
  - CSRF tokens or other security measures
  - Different field names than expected

### 4. Navigation After Login
❌ Could not test post-login navigation due to login failure

## Manual Testing Instructions

Since automated browser testing requires additional setup, here are the manual steps to verify:

1. **Open browser and navigate to** http://localhost:5651
2. **Screenshot 1**: Take a screenshot of the initial page showing the navigation menu
3. **Click the LOGIN button** in the navigation
4. **On the login form**, enter:
   - Email: admin@witchcityrope.com
   - Password: Test123!
5. **Submit the form**
6. **Wait 3-5 seconds** for the page to load
7. **Screenshot 2**: Take a screenshot of the page after login
8. **Check the following**:
   - Current URL (has it changed?)
   - Is the LOGIN button gone from navigation?
   - Is there a LOGOUT option?
   - Is there a "My Dashboard" link?
   - Is there any user profile indicator?

## Recommendations

1. **For automated testing**, consider:
   - Installing Selenium in a virtual environment
   - Using Playwright or Puppeteer as alternatives
   - Setting up a proper test environment with ChromeDriver

2. **For the login implementation**, verify:
   - The expected content-type for login requests
   - Whether CSRF protection is enabled
   - The exact field names expected by the backend

3. **API Documentation** would help clarify:
   - The correct login endpoint and method
   - Required headers and payload format
   - Expected responses for successful/failed login

## Current Navigation Structure

The application has a clear navigation structure with:
- Desktop nav: horizontal menu with LOGIN button
- Mobile nav: includes additional items like "Report an Incident" and "Private Lessons"
- AUTH section: Currently shows only LOGIN, should update to show user options after authentication
