# Current State Analysis - Login Navigation

## Executive Summary
The login system is functional, but the post-login navigation menu update is broken due to an unimplemented method in AuthService that always returns null user data.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. GetCurrentUserAsync() Not Implemented
**Location**: `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Services/AuthService.cs` (lines 16-20)
```csharp
public async Task<UserDto?> GetCurrentUserAsync()
{
    // TODO: Implement getting current user from auth state
    return await Task.FromResult<UserDto?>(null);
}
```
**Impact**: MainLayout's `_currentUser` is always null, so authenticated menu items never appear.

### 2. No Real-Time Navigation Updates
**Issue**: MainLayout doesn't subscribe to authentication state changes
**Impact**: Even if GetCurrentUserAsync() worked, the menu wouldn't update after login without a page refresh

### 3. Model Mismatch
**Issue**: Different user models between services:
- AuthService expects `UserDto`
- AuthenticationService uses `UserInfo`
- No proper mapping between them

## Current Login Flow

### Working Parts
1. Login form submission works correctly
2. API authentication succeeds
3. Tokens are stored properly
4. User is redirected to dashboard
5. Protected routes require authentication

### Broken Parts
1. Navigation menu doesn't update after login
2. User dropdown never appears
3. Admin panel link never shows
4. Must refresh page to see any navigation changes

## Navigation Structure

### Unauthenticated Users See
- Events & Classes
- How To Join  
- Resources
- Login button

### Authenticated Users Should See (but don't)
- Everything above
- My Dashboard
- User dropdown with:
  - My Profile
  - My Tickets
  - Settings
  - Admin Panel (admin only)
  - Logout

## Root Cause Analysis

The navigation update fails because:
1. `GetCurrentUserAsync()` returns null
2. No authentication state change subscription
3. No `StateHasChanged()` trigger after login
4. Model mapping between services is missing

## Required Fixes

### Priority 1 - Implement GetCurrentUserAsync()
Map AuthenticationService's UserInfo to AuthService's UserDto

### Priority 2 - Add State Change Subscription
MainLayout must listen for authentication changes

### Priority 3 - Fix Model Consistency
Ensure consistent user models across services

### Priority 4 - Add Tests
Verify navigation updates work for all user roles
