# Events Management Page Debug Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. API Container Not Starting (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** The API container was failing to start with dependency injection errors.

**Root Causes:**
- Missing service registrations for `IEmailService` and `IPaymentService` when environment variables were not configured
- Missing registration for API-specific adapters (`EmailServiceAdapter`, `EncryptionServiceAdapter`)
- Duplicate authentication scheme registration

**Fixes Applied:**
1. Created mock implementations for development:
   - `/src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure/Services/MockEmailService.cs`
   - `/src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure/Services/MockPaymentService.cs`

2. Updated `/src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure/DependencyInjection.Identity.cs` to always register services (mock or real)

3. Added service adapter registrations in `/src/WitchCityRope.Api/Infrastructure/ApiConfiguration.cs`:
   ```csharp
   services.AddScoped<WitchCityRope.Api.Features.Auth.Services.IEmailService, 
       WitchCityRope.Api.Features.Auth.Services.EmailServiceAdapter>();
   services.AddScoped<WitchCityRope.Api.Features.Auth.Services.IEncryptionService, 
       WitchCityRope.Api.Features.Auth.Services.EncryptionServiceAdapter>();
   ```

4. Removed duplicate cookie authentication configuration in `/src/WitchCityRope.Api/Program.cs`

### 2. Missing Admin Events Endpoint (FIXED ✅)
**Problem:** The `/api/admin/events` endpoint didn't exist.

**Fix Applied:** Added a mock endpoint to `/src/WitchCityRope.Api/Features/Events/EventsController.cs` that returns sample data to unblock the UI.

## Current Status

### ✅ Working:
- API container is now running and listening on port 8080 (internal) / 5653 (external)
- The `/api/admin/events` endpoint exists and returns 401 Unauthorized (expected for unauthenticated requests)
- Web container can communicate with API container via internal Docker network
- No more connection refused errors

### ⚠️ Remaining Issues:
1. **Database Migrations:** The API shows a warning about pending migrations
2. **Authentication:** The Events Management page requires admin authentication to access
3. **Real Data:** The endpoint currently returns mock data instead of querying the database

## Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migrations:**
   ```bash
   docker exec witchcity-api dotnet ef database update
   ```

2. **Implement Proper Event Service:**
   - Create a proper implementation for fetching events with management data
   - Replace the mock data in the controller with actual database queries

3. **Test with Admin Account:**
   - Ensure an admin user exists in the database
   - Login with admin credentials to access the Events Management page

## How to Verify the Fix

1. Check API is running:
   ```bash
   curl -i http://localhost:5653/api/admin/events
   ```
   Should return 401 Unauthorized

2. Check from web container:
   ```bash
   docker exec witchcity-web curl -i http://api:8080/api/admin/events
   ```
   Should also return 401 Unauthorized

3. Login as admin and navigate to: http://localhost:5651/admin/events

The Events Management page should now load and display the mock events data once authenticated as an admin user.
