## Technical Notes

### Database Schema (Planned)
- Users (with membership status enum)
- Events (Classes vs Meetups)
- Registrations (with payment tracking)
- VettingApplications
- Payments
- IncidentReports

### Key Business Rules
- Age requirement: 21+
- Classes: Public, paid in advance ($35-65)
- Meetups: Members only, optional payment ($0-35)
- Refunds: Until 48-72 hours before event
- Capacity: Usually 60 people max

## Development Patterns

### Vertical Slice Example (Direct Services)
```
Features/Events/
├── EventService.cs       # Business logic with direct methods
├── EventModels.cs        # DTOs and entities
├── EventValidators.cs    # FluentValidation rules
└── EventExtensions.cs    # Helper methods
```

### Naming Conventions
- Scene names (public) vs Legal names (encrypted)
- Feature-first organization
- Minimal abstractions for MVP

## Known Issues/Decisions

1. **Name-based check-in** - Manual name search for event check-in (no QR codes)
2. **Honor system** - For sliding scale payments
3. **Trust-based** - Staff can override payment/waiver requirements
4. **Privacy-first** - Legal names only visible to admins
5. **Unified Events View** - My Events page shows both tickets and RSVPs together
6. **Couples Tickets** - Purchaser maintains control, can assign second ticket to partner

## Questions for Next Session

1. Payment flow specifics with PayPal
2. Email template requirements
3. Discord integration approach
4. Waiver expiration policy (currently no expiration)
