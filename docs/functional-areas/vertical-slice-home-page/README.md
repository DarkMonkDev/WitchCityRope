# Vertical Slice: Home Page with Events Display

## Purpose
Test the complete workflow process and technology stack by implementing a minimal home page that displays events from the API.

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Requirements & Planning
- [ ] Analyze current home page functionality
- [ ] Define minimal requirements for vertical slice
- [ ] Create business requirements document
- [ ] **HUMAN REVIEW POINT**

### Phase 2: Design & Architecture  
- [ ] UI mockup for home page
- [ ] API endpoint design
- [ ] Data flow architecture
- [ ] Component structure planning

### Phase 3: Implementation
- [ ] Backend: Events API controller (backend-developer)
- [ ] Frontend: React home page (react-developer)
- [ ] API integration setup
- [ ] **HUMAN REVIEW POINT** (after first working version)

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Unit tests (test-developer)
- [ ] Integration tests (test-executor)
- [ ] E2E tests with Playwright
- [ ] Code quality validation (lint-validator)
- [ ] Code formatting (prettier-formatter)

### Phase 5: Finalization
- [ ] Document lessons learned
- [ ] Update migration patterns
- [ ] Clean up temporary files

## Sub-Agents Involved
- ui-designer (React-centric)
- react-developer (new)
- backend-developer
- test-developer
- test-executor
- lint-validator (code quality)
- prettier-formatter (code formatting)
- librarian (for cleanup)

## Success Criteria
1. Home page fetches and displays events
2. Full workflow process tested
3. All sub-agents functioning correctly
4. Lessons learned documented
5. Patterns established for rest of migration
