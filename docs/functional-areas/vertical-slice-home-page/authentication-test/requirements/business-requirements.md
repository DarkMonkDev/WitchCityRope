# Business Requirements: Authentication Vertical Slice Test
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-16 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary
This is a technical proof-of-concept to validate the Hybrid JWT + HttpOnly Cookies authentication approach for the WitchCityRope React migration. This throwaway implementation will prove the authentication pattern works before committing to full migration implementation. The test will validate service-to-service authentication capabilities that are critical for the microservices architecture.

## Business Context
### Problem Statement
The React migration requires a validated authentication approach that supports both browser-based authentication (via HttpOnly cookies) and service-to-service authentication (via JWT tokens). Multiple authentication solutions were evaluated, and the decision was made to use ASP.NET Core Identity with Hybrid JWT + HttpOnly Cookies. Before implementing this approach in the full migration, we need to prove the pattern works correctly.

### Business Value
- **Risk Mitigation**: Validates authentication approach before full implementation
- **Technical Validation**: Proves service-to-service JWT communication works
- **Implementation Confidence**: Confirms 1-2 day implementation timeline is realistic
- **Architecture Validation**: Tests React + Web Service + API Service authentication flow

### Success Metrics
- Authentication success rate: >99%
- API response time for protected endpoints: <200ms
- Zero authentication-related security vulnerabilities
- Complete implementation in 1-2 days

## User Stories

### Story 1: User Registration
**As a** potential community member
**I want to** register with email, password, and scene name
**So that** I can create an account to access WitchCityRope

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am on the registration page
- When I enter valid email, password, and scene name
- Then my account is created successfully
- And I receive a confirmation message
- And I can immediately log in with my credentials

### Story 2: User Login
**As a** registered user
**I want to** log in with my email and password
**So that** I can access protected content

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have a valid account
- When I enter correct email and password
- Then I am authenticated via HttpOnly cookie
- And I am redirected to the protected welcome page
- And my authentication state persists across page refreshes

### Story 3: Protected Content Access
**As an** authenticated user
**I want to** view protected content
**So that** I can see personalized information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am logged in
- When I navigate to the protected page
- Then I see "Welcome [scene name]" message
- And the page displays my user information
- And unauthenticated users cannot access this page

### Story 4: Public Content Access
**As any** user (authenticated or not)
**I want to** view public content
**So that** I can see general information about WitchCityRope

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am on the site (authenticated or not)
- When I navigate to the events page
- Then I can view public event information
- And authentication is not required

### Story 5: API Authentication
**As the** Web Service
**I want to** authenticate API calls with JWT tokens
**So that** I can securely access business logic in the API Service

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a user is authenticated via cookie
- When the Web Service makes API calls
- Then JWT tokens are automatically included in API requests
- And the API Service validates tokens successfully
- And protected API endpoints return data correctly

### Story 6: User Logout
**As an** authenticated user
**I want to** log out of my account
**So that** my session is terminated securely

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am logged in
- When I click the logout button
- Then my authentication cookie is cleared
- And I am redirected to a public page
- And I can no longer access protected content
- And subsequent API calls are not authenticated

## Business Rules
1. **Password Requirements**: Minimum 8 characters, must contain uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character
2. **Email Validation**: Must be valid email format and unique in system
3. **Scene Name Requirements**: Must be unique, 3-50 characters, alphanumeric and spaces only
4. **Session Duration**: Authentication cookies expire after 30 days for security
5. **JWT Tokens**: Service-to-service tokens expire after 1 hour
6. **Cookie Security**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict for maximum protection
7. **API Access**: Protected API endpoints require valid JWT token

## Technical Validation Goals
### Authentication Flow Validation
- Verify HttpOnly cookie creation and management
- Test JWT token generation for service-to-service calls
- Validate token refresh mechanisms
- Confirm secure cookie transmission (HTTPS only)

### Security Validation
- OWASP Top 10 compliance check
- XSS prevention via HttpOnly cookies
- CSRF protection via SameSite=Strict
- SQL injection prevention in authentication queries

### Architecture Validation
- React → Web Service (cookie-based) communication
- Web Service → API Service (JWT-based) communication
- Proper error handling for authentication failures
- Seamless user experience across services

## Constraints & Assumptions
### Constraints
- **Technical**: Must use ASP.NET Core Identity with PostgreSQL
- **Technical**: React frontend must use fetch with credentials: 'include'
- **Technical**: No OAuth integration (deferred to Phase 3)
- **Business**: This is throwaway code - not production quality
- **Business**: Keep implementation minimal for validation only

### Assumptions
- PostgreSQL database is available for testing
- HTTPS is configured for cookie security
- React development environment supports cookie-based authentication
- JWT token validation works with existing API patterns

## Security & Privacy Requirements
- **Password Storage**: Use ASP.NET Core Identity password hashing
- **Cookie Security**: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Strict configuration
- **Token Security**: JWT tokens use secure signing and short expiration
- **Input Validation**: All form inputs validated server-side
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Use parameterized queries only
- **XSS Prevention**: Proper input sanitization and HttpOnly cookies
- **Session Management**: Secure logout clears all authentication state

## Compliance Requirements
- **OWASP**: Follow OWASP authentication guidelines
- **Privacy**: Minimal data collection for test (email, scene name only)
- **Data Retention**: Test data can be deleted after validation

## User Impact Analysis
| User Type | Impact | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Test Users | Can create accounts and test authentication | High |
| Developers | Validates implementation approach | High |
| Product Team | Confirms architecture decisions | High |
| End Users | No impact (test environment only) | N/A |

## Examples/Scenarios
### Scenario 1: Successful Authentication Flow
1. User navigates to registration page
2. User enters: email "test@example.com", password "TestPass123!", scene name "TestUser"
3. User submits registration form
4. System creates account and logs user in
5. User is redirected to protected welcome page showing "Welcome TestUser"
6. User navigates to events page (public) - works without re-authentication
7. User refreshes browser - remains authenticated
8. User clicks logout - redirected to public page, authentication cleared

### Scenario 2: Service-to-Service Authentication
1. User logs in via React frontend
2. React makes request to Web Service protected endpoint
3. Web Service generates JWT token for API call
4. Web Service calls API Service with JWT Bearer token
5. API Service validates JWT and returns data
6. Web Service returns data to React frontend
7. User sees personalized data from API

### Scenario 3: Authentication Failure
1. User attempts to access protected page without login
2. System redirects to login page
3. User enters invalid credentials
4. System shows error message
5. User cannot access protected content

## Out of Scope
- **OAuth Integration** (Google, Facebook) - Phase 3
- **Password Reset** functionality
- **Two-Factor Authentication** (2FA)
- **Role-based Access Control** beyond basic authentication
- **User Profile Management** beyond basic registration
- **Email Verification** workflow
- **Account Lockout** policies
- **Remember Me** functionality
- **Production-quality UI/UX** - basic functional UI only
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** - basic validation only
- **Load Testing** or performance optimization
- **Admin User Management** features
