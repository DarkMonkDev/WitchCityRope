# Vertical Slice Home Page - Progress Tracking
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-16 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Orchestrator Agent -->
<!-- Status: In Progress -->

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of DUAL vertical slice implementations through all workflow phases. These implementations serve as comprehensive tests of the complete workflow process, sub-agent coordination, and critical authentication architecture validation.

**üéÜ DUAL VERTICAL SLICE SUCCESS**:
1. **Events Vertical Slice**: Home page displaying events from PostgreSQL (COMPLETE)
2. **Authentication Vertical Slice**: Full authentication flow with Hybrid JWT + HttpOnly Cookies (COMPLETE)

**üî¥ CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Authentication vertical slice revealed service-to-service requirements that changed migration strategy from NextAuth.js to ASP.NET Core Identity, saving $550+/month vs commercial alternatives.
