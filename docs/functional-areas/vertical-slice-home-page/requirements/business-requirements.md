# Business Requirements: Vertical Slice Home Page with Events Display
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-16 -->
<!-- Version: 2.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Ready for Review -->

## Executive Summary
Implement a minimal but complete home page for the React migration that displays upcoming events from the API. This is a **technical proof-of-concept vertical slice** to validate the entire technology stack and workflow process. **This project will likely be throwaway code** meant to test the technology stack and document lessons learned before migrating the actual API structure from the old project.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
The WitchCityRope platform is migrating from Blazor Server to React + TypeScript with a separate API microservice. We need to validate the complete technology stack and workflow process before proceeding with the full migration. This is a **technical test only** - not a production feature.

### Technical Validation Goals
- **React ↔ API Communication**: Prove React frontend can call API endpoints
- **Database Integration**: Test PostgreSQL setup and API-to-database communication  
- **Workflow Validation**: Test the complete 5-phase development process with all sub-agents
- **Technology Stack Proof**: Validate React + TypeScript + Vite + .NET API + PostgreSQL works together

## Progressive Testing Approach

### Step 1: Hardcoded API Response
- API returns hardcoded event data (no database)
- Proves React ↔ API communication works

### Step 2: Database Integration  
- Implement PostgreSQL database with basic Event table
- API pulls event data from database instead of hardcoded values
- **Note**: Database entities will likely be thrown away - this is just testing DB setup and communication

## User Stories

### Story 1: View Events from API (Technical Test)
**As a** developer testing the stack
**I want to** see events displayed from the API
**So that** I can verify React ↔ API communication works

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I visit the home page
- When the page loads
- Then I see events fetched from the API
- And events display in a simple card format
- And console shows no errors

### Story 2: See Loading State During API Call
**As a** developer testing the stack
**I want to** see a loading indicator while events are being fetched
**So that** I can verify loading states work correctly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I visit the home page
- When events are being fetched from the API
- Then I see a loading spinner
- And loading state disappears when data loads

### Story 3: Handle API Errors (Basic)
**As a** developer testing the stack
**I want to** see an error message if the API fails
**So that** I can verify error handling works

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the API is unavailable
- When I visit the home page  
- Then I see a basic error message
- And the page doesn't crash

### Story 4: Display Events in Card Format
**As a** developer testing the stack
**I want to** see events in a card layout
**So that** I can verify basic responsive design works

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given events load successfully
- When I view the home page
- Then events display in card format
- And layout is responsive (stacks on mobile)

### Story 5: Test Database Integration (Step 2)
**As a** developer testing the stack
**I want to** see events pulled from PostgreSQL database
**So that** I can verify full database integration works

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the database contains event records
- When I visit the home page
- Then events display from database (not hardcoded)
- And API successfully queries PostgreSQL

## Technical Requirements

### API Requirements
- **Step 1**: Return hardcoded JSON array of 2-3 events
- **Step 2**: Query PostgreSQL database for events
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/events`
- **Response**: JSON array of Event objects

### Database Requirements (Step 2)
- Basic Event table in PostgreSQL
- Minimal schema: id, title, description, startDate, location
- **Note**: This schema will likely be discarded - just for testing

### Frontend Requirements
- Simple React component structure
- Basic loading spinner
- Simple error message display
- Responsive card layout (CSS Grid/Flexbox)
- **No authentication required**

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use React + TypeScript with Vite
- Must communicate with .NET Minimal API backend
- Must test PostgreSQL database integration
- Basic responsive design (mobile stacks vertically)

### Scope Limitations
- **No user authentication** 
- **No complex business rules**
- **No performance optimization**
- **No SEO requirements**
- **No accessibility testing beyond basics**
- **No member-only content**
- **No event booking/registration**
- **No admin features**

### Assumptions
- This is throwaway code for technical validation
- Database entities will be redesigned for production
- Focus is on proving stack communication, not features

## Mock Data Structure

Simple Event interface for testing:

```typescript
interface Event {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  startDate: string;  // ISO 8601 string
  location: string;
}
```

**Sample Test Data:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "title": "Test Workshop",
    "description": "A test workshop for validating the tech stack",
    "startDate": "2025-08-25T14:00:00Z",
    "location": "Salem, MA"
  },
  {
    "id": "2", 
    "title": "Another Test Event",
    "description": "Another event to verify list display works",
    "startDate": "2025-08-30T19:00:00Z", 
    "location": "Salem, MA"
  }
]
```

## Success Criteria

### Technical Validation Success
- [ ] React app successfully calls API endpoint
- [ ] API returns JSON data (Step 1: hardcoded, Step 2: from database)
- [ ] Events display on frontend without errors
- [ ] Basic responsive layout works
- [ ] Loading states function
- [ ] Basic error handling works
- [ ] PostgreSQL database integration works (Step 2)

### Workflow Validation Success  
- [ ] All 5 workflow phases complete
- [ ] Sub-agents coordinate successfully
- [ ] Human review points function
- [ ] Quality gates pass
- [ ] Documentation generated properly

## Questions for Product Manager

- [ ] Should we proceed with Step 1 (hardcoded) or jump to Step 2 (database)?
- [ ] Any specific technical constraints for the database schema?
- [ ] How detailed should the error handling be for this proof-of-concept?

## Quality Gate Checklist (Simplified for POC)

### Core Requirements
- [ ] Technical validation goals clearly defined
- [ ] Progressive testing approach documented  
- [ ] Scope appropriately limited for POC
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Mock data structure defined

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] API endpoint specified
- [ ] Database approach documented
- [ ] Frontend requirements listed
- [ ] Error handling approach defined

**Next Phase:** Design & Architecture (ui-designer creates simple mockups and component structure)
**Human Review Required:** Product Manager approval before proceeding to design phase  
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 development days for complete technical proof-of-concept
**Risk Level:** Low (minimal scope, focused on technical validation)
**Note:** This is throwaway code for stack validation - production implementation will be different
