### 6. Integration Points

#### API Endpoints Needed (TODOs in code)
- Event CRUD with new fields
- Volunteer task management
- Email template CRUD
- Custom email sending
- Volunteer ticket assignment

#### Service Layer Requirements

   - Service layer methods
   - Repository updates

2. **Database Migration**
   - Generate and apply EF Core migration
   - Seed test data

3. **Integration Testing**
   - Connect UI to actual API endpoints
   - Test full data flow
   - Verify public page display

4. **Production Readiness**
   - Performance optimization
   - Error handling
   - Logging and monitoring
