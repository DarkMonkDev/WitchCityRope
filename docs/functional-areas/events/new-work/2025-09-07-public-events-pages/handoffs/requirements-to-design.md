<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-07 -->
<!-- Handoff From: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Handoff To: UI Designer, React Developer -->

## 🚨 CRITICAL HANDOFF INFORMATION

### Project Context
**Phase 4: Public Events Pages Implementation**
- ✅ **Phase 3 Complete**: Event Session Matrix admin UI + Backend APIs operational
- ✅ **Complete Wireframes Available**: All public event page designs exist in `/docs/functional-areas/events/public-events/`
- 🎯 **This Phase Goal**: Transform wireframes into production React components with backend integration

### Required Reading BEFORE Starting
1. **Complete Wireframes**: 
   - `/docs/functional-areas/events/public-events/event-list.html`
   - `/docs/functional-areas/events/public-events/event-detail.html`
2. **Business Requirements**: `/docs/functional-areas/events/new-work/2025-09-07-public-events-pages/requirements/business-requirements.md`
3. **Existing Design System**: `/docs/functional-areas/events/new-work/2025-08-24-events-management/` (admin UI patterns)

## 💡 TOP 5 CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES

### 1. Event Type Display Logic - NON-NEGOTIABLE
```
Classes (Educational Events):
- Show ONLY "Register Now" button (paid tickets required)
- No free RSVP option available
- Display pricing clearly with sliding scale

Social Events (Community Gatherings):
- Show BOTH "RSVP Free" + "Buy Ticket" buttons
- RSVP reserves spot without payment
- Members can upgrade RSVP to paid ticket later
```

### 2. Member Access Control - SECURITY CRITICAL
```
Member-Only Events:
- Non-members: Limited info + login prompt
- Vetted Members: Full details + venue location
- General Members: Depends on event vetting requirement

Venue Information:
- Hidden until registration confirmed
- "Location details revealed after registration"
```

### 3. Capacity Management - REAL-TIME CRITICAL
```
Capacity Display Requirements:
- "X of Y spots available" with visual progress bar
- "Only X spots left!" (red) when <20% remaining  
- "Waitlist Available" when full
- Real-time updates during user session
```

### 4. Sliding Scale Pricing - COMMUNITY VALUES
```
Display Format: "$35 - $55 sliding scale"
User Interface: Interactive slider for price selection
Explanation: "Pay what you can within this range - no questions asked"
No judgment/validation on price selection within range
```

### 5. Mobile-First Experience - 65% OF TRAFFIC
```
Performance Target: <2 seconds page load
Touch-friendly: All buttons/forms optimized for mobile
Responsive: Seamless desktop/tablet/mobile experience
Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required
```

## ⚙️ TECHNICAL HANDOFF REQUIREMENTS

### Architecture Integration
- **Backend APIs**: Phase 3 APIs available at established endpoints
- **Authentication**: Integrate with existing JWT + role-based system
- **Type Safety**: Use NSwag generated types (NO manual interfaces)
- **Component Library**: Mantine v7 with WitchCityRope theming

### API Integration Points
```
Event List: GET /api/events (with filtering parameters)
Event Details: GET /api/events/{id}
User Registration: POST /api/events/{id}/register
RSVP Submission: POST /api/events/{id}/rsvp
User Auth Status: Integration with existing auth context
```

### State Management Requirements
- **Event Data**: Server state with TanStack Query patterns
- **User Authentication**: Existing Zustand auth store integration  
- **Form State**: Local form state with validation
- **Filter State**: URL-synced filter parameters for bookmarking

### Performance Requirements
- **Page Load**: <2 seconds for event list page
- **API Response**: Integrate with existing <200ms API targets
- **Image Optimization**: Lazy loading for event images
- **Caching**: Smart caching of event data with real-time capacity updates

## 📱 USER EXPERIENCE PRIORITIES

### Registration Flow Optimization
1. **Social Event RSVP**: Quick modal flow with minimal fields
2. **Class Registration**: Multi-step form with price selection
3. **Guest Registration**: Additional consent/waiver requirements
4. **Waitlist Flow**: Clear expectations and positioning information

### Error States and Edge Cases
- **Capacity Reached**: Graceful waitlist presentation
- **Authentication Required**: Clear login/signup prompts
- **Payment Failures**: Helpful error messages and retry options
- **Form Validation**: Inline validation with accessible error messages

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Screen Readers**: Full content accessible via screen readers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements keyboard accessible
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order

## 🔒 SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS

### Data Protection
- **Member Privacy**: Protect member-only event details from public view
- **Venue Security**: Hide exact locations until registration confirmed
- **Personal Data**: Encrypt all form submissions and personal information
- **Role Verification**: Server-side validation of user permissions

### Content Security
- **XSS Protection**: Sanitize all user-generated content
- **CSRF Protection**: Proper token handling for form submissions
- **Input Validation**: Client and server-side validation alignment
- **Session Management**: Proper handling of expired authentication

## ⚡ EDGE CASES AND SPECIAL SCENARIOS

### High-Priority Edge Cases
1. **Rapid Capacity Changes**: Multiple users registering simultaneously
2. **Payment Processing Delays**: Registration holds during payment processing
3. **Network Failures**: Offline capability and retry mechanisms
4. **Session Expiration**: Graceful re-authentication during registration

### Community-Specific Scenarios
1. **New Member Discovery**: Clear pathways from public events to membership
2. **Guest Registration**: Additional requirements and limitation communication
3. **Repeat Attendees**: Recognition and streamlined re-registration
4. **Multi-Session Events**: Clear display of session relationships (S1, S2, S3)
