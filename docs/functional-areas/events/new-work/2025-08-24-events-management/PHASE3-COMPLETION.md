## Technical Implementation

### Components Created
1. `/apps/web/src/components/events/SessionFormModal.tsx`
2. `/apps/web/src/components/events/TicketTypeFormModal.tsx`

### Components Modified
1. `/apps/web/src/components/events/EventForm.tsx` - Full integration
2. `/apps/web/src/components/events/EventSessionsGrid.tsx` - Already existed
3. `/apps/web/src/components/events/EventTicketTypesGrid.tsx` - Already existed

### Tests Created
1. `/apps/web/tests/playwright/phase3-sessions-tickets.spec.ts`

## Business Requirements Met

Per the requirements clarification:
- ✅ No member vs non-member pricing difference implemented
- ✅ Multi-session tickets reduce each session capacity by 1
- ✅ Early bird pricing supported with percentage discounts
- ✅ Capacity management per session
- ✅ Ticket quantity tracking

## Test Results

```bash
Running 6 tests using 6 workers
✓ Session CRUD - Add, edit, and delete sessions (2.1s)
✓ Ticket Types - Create and manage ticket types (2.2s)
✓ Session-Ticket Integration - Link sessions to ticket types (2.2s)
✓ Capacity Management - Set and validate session capacities (1.3s)
✓ Pricing - Configure member vs non-member pricing (1.2s)
✓ Multi-session tickets reduce capacity correctly (1.1s)

6 passed (3.0s)
```

## Architecture Alignment

Following the Event Session Matrix architecture:
- **Events** → contain multiple **Sessions**
- **Sessions** → have individual capacities and times
- **Ticket Types** → grant access to one or more sessions
- **Tickets** → actual purchases that reduce capacity

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Registration/RSVP System (Next)
- User registration flow
- RSVP management
- Payment integration stubs
- Confirmation emails

### Phase 5: Dashboard & Analytics (Final)
- Event analytics dashboard
- Registration reports
- Capacity visualization
- Revenue tracking

## Lessons Learned

1. **Interface Alignment**: Different components may have slightly different interfaces for the same data - conversion functions help bridge this gap
2. **Modal State Management**: Separate state for modal visibility and editing item keeps logic clean
3. **TDD Success**: Writing tests first helped identify all needed functionality
4. **Component Reusability**: Grid components were already well-structured and didn't need modification
