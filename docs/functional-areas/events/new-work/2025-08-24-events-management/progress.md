# Events Management React Migration Progress
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-24 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Orchestrator Agent -->
<!-- Status: Active -->

## Executive Summary

Migrating Events Management system from nearly-complete Blazor implementation to React + TypeScript architecture. Substantial existing documentation and wireframes available for accelerated development.

## Workflow Status: Phase 1 - Requirements Analysis

**Status**: Phase 1 Started
**Current Phase**: Requirements Analysis & Architecture Review
**Next Phase**: Design Review

### Phase Progress

| Phase | Status | Progress | Quality Gate | Next Review |
|-------|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1: Requirements** | üöÄ ACTIVE | 5% | 0% ‚Üí 95% | After requirements complete |
| Phase 2: Design | üèÉ READY | 0% | 0% ‚Üí 90% | After design complete |
| Phase 3: Implementation | ‚è≥ WAITING | 0% | 0% ‚Üí 85% | After first vertical slice |
| Phase 4: Testing | ‚è≥ WAITING | 0% | 0% ‚Üí 100% | Before finalization |
| Phase 5: Finalization | ‚è≥ WAITING | 0% | 100% | Project complete |

### Current Tasks

#### Active Work - Phase 1
- [ ] Review existing Blazor Events documentation at `/docs/functional-areas/events/`
- [ ] Analyze Events business requirements
- [ ] Document React-specific architectural decisions
- [ ] Validate Events API endpoints and DTOs
- [ ] Create Events migration strategy
- [ ] Update existing wireframes for React patterns

## Architecture Context

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: Mantine v7 (confirmed via ADR-004)
- **API Integration**: TanStack Query + NSwag generated types
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Authentication**: httpOnly cookies + JWT (implemented)

### Existing Assets to Leverage

#### Documentation
- Events functional design at `/docs/functional-areas/events/functional-design.md`
- User flows at `/docs/functional-areas/events/user-flows.md`
- Test coverage at `/docs/functional-areas/events/test-coverage.md`
- Business requirements at `/docs/functional-areas/events/requirements/business-requirements.md`

#### Design Assets
- Admin Events Management wireframes
- Event checkin wireframes
- Public events wireframes
- Event creation wireframes

#### API Layer
- Existing EventsController.cs
- Event.cs model
- EventDto.cs DTOs
- EventService.cs business logic

## Success Criteria

### Business Value
- Complete Events system migration from Blazor to React
- Maintain all existing Events functionality
- Improve user experience with modern React patterns
- Leverage existing API layer investment

### Quality Gates
- Phase 1: Requirements review with 95% stakeholder approval
- Phase 2: Design review with architectural validation
- Phase 3: First vertical slice demonstration
- Phase 4: Full test suite with 100% critical path coverage
- Phase 5: Production deployment readiness

## Risk Mitigation

### Low Risk Areas
- ‚úÖ Authentication system already implemented
- ‚úÖ API architecture established
- ‚úÖ UI component library selected (Mantine v7)
- ‚úÖ Type generation pipeline operational (NSwag)

### Medium Risk Areas
- Events-specific business logic complexity
- RSVP and ticketing workflows
- Admin event management permissions

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Today): Complete requirements analysis phase
2. **Next Session**: Design review and wireframe updates
3. **Implementation**: Begin with event listing vertical slice
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright
