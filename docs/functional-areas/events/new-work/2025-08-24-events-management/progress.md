# Events Management React Migration Progress
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-06 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Orchestrator Agent -->
<!-- Status: Active -->

## Executive Summary

Migrating Events Management system from nearly-complete Blazor implementation to React + TypeScript architecture. Substantial existing documentation and wireframes available for accelerated development.

## Workflow Status: Phase 3 - Implementation

**Status**: Phase 3 Active - Backend API Complete, Frontend Integration Next
**Current Phase**: Backend API Implementation Complete, Frontend Integration Starting
**Next Phase**: React Component Development

### Phase Progress

| Phase | Status | Progress | Quality Gate | Next Review |
|-------|--------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Phase 1: Requirements** | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | 100% | 95% ‚úÖ | Requirements approved |
| Phase 2: Design | ‚úÖ COMPLETE | 100% | 90% ‚úÖ | Design approved |
| **Phase 3: Implementation** | üöÄ ACTIVE | 40% | 0% ‚Üí 85% | After frontend integration |
| Phase 4: Testing | ‚è≥ WAITING | 0% | 0% ‚Üí 100% | Before finalization |
| Phase 5: Finalization | ‚è≥ WAITING | 0% | 100% | Project complete |

### Current Tasks

#### Completed Work - Phases 1 & 2
- [x] Review existing Blazor Events documentation at `/docs/functional-areas/events/`
- [x] Analyze Events business requirements
- [x] Document React-specific architectural decisions
- [x] Validate Events API endpoints and DTOs
- [x] Create Events migration strategy
- [x] Update existing wireframes for React patterns

#### Completed Work - Phase 3 Backend
- [x] **Backend API Implementation Complete** (Commit: 9ea9180)
- [x] EventsManagementService with tuple return pattern
- [x] Three working GET endpoints:
  - GET /api/events (all events with filtering)
  - GET /api/events/{id} (single event details)
  - GET /api/events/{id}/availability (event availability status)
- [x] DTOs ready for NSwag TypeScript generation
- [x] Unit tests created and passing
- [x] Follows Event Session Matrix architecture

#### Active Work - Phase 3 Frontend
- [ ] Generate TypeScript interfaces with NSwag
- [ ] Create React components for event listing
- [ ] Implement API integration with TanStack Query
- [ ] Build event detail views
- [ ] Create event availability display
- [ ] Integration testing with real API endpoints

## Architecture Context

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: Mantine v7 (confirmed via ADR-004)
- **API Integration**: TanStack Query + NSwag generated types
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Authentication**: httpOnly cookies + JWT (implemented)

### Existing Assets to Leverage

#### Documentation
- Events functional design at `/docs/functional-areas/events/functional-design.md`
- User flows at `/docs/functional-areas/events/user-flows.md`
- Test coverage at `/docs/functional-areas/events/test-coverage.md`
- Business requirements at `/docs/functional-areas/events/requirements/business-requirements.md`

#### Design Assets
- Admin Events Management wireframes
- Event checkin wireframes
- Public events wireframes
- Event creation wireframes

#### API Layer
- Existing EventsController.cs
- Event.cs model
- EventDto.cs DTOs
- EventService.cs business logic

## Success Criteria

### Business Value
- Complete Events system migration from Blazor to React
- Maintain all existing Events functionality
- Improve user experience with modern React patterns
- Leverage existing API layer investment

### Quality Gates
- Phase 1: Requirements review with 95% stakeholder approval
- Phase 2: Design review with architectural validation
- Phase 3: First vertical slice demonstration
- Phase 4: Full test suite with 100% critical path coverage
- Phase 5: Production deployment readiness

## Risk Mitigation

### Low Risk Areas
- ‚úÖ Authentication system already implemented
- ‚úÖ API architecture established
- ‚úÖ UI component library selected (Mantine v7)
- ‚úÖ Type generation pipeline operational (NSwag)

### Medium Risk Areas
- Events-specific business logic complexity
- RSVP and ticketing workflows
- Admin event management permissions

## Backend API Achievements

### First Vertical Slice Complete ‚úÖ
- **GET Endpoints Implementation**: All three core endpoints working
- **EventsManagementService**: Clean service layer with tuple return pattern
- **DTOs**: Comprehensive data transfer objects ready for frontend consumption
- **Unit Testing**: Full test coverage for service layer
- **Architecture Compliance**: Follows established Event Session Matrix patterns

### API Endpoints Available
1. **GET /api/events**: List all events with optional filtering
2. **GET /api/events/{id}**: Single event with full details
3. **GET /api/events/{id}/availability**: Event availability and capacity

### Technical Implementation Details
- **Service Pattern**: EventsManagementService with (success, data, error) tuple returns
- **Error Handling**: Consistent API response patterns
- **Data Models**: Event, EventDto, EventAvailabilityDto fully implemented
- **Testing**: Unit tests validate all business logic paths

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (Next Session): Frontend React component development
2. **Priority 1**: NSwag type generation and API integration
3. **Priority 2**: Event listing and detail view components
4. **Priority 3**: Integration testing with real backend
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive E2E testing with Playwright
