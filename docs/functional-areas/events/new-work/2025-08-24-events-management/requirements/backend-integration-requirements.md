# Business Requirements: Events Management System - Backend API Integration
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-25 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft - Phase 2 Backend Integration -->

## Executive Summary
This document defines the comprehensive business requirements for integrating the completed Event Session Matrix Demo UI with a robust .NET Minimal API backend. The scope includes Events API development, registration system implementation, volunteer management, data persistence layer, and security/access control framework to transform the demo into a production-ready event management system.

## Business Context
### Problem Statement
The Events Management System Demo UI is complete with all 4 functional tabs (Basic Info, Tickets/Orders, Emails, Volunteers) and full TinyMCE integration. However, the system currently operates with mock data and requires a robust backend API to enable real event management workflows, persistent data storage, and integration with the existing WitchCityRope authentication system.

### Business Value
- **Operational Efficiency**: Transform 70% manual event administration into automated workflows
- **Revenue Growth**: Enable reliable payment processing and automated refund systems
- **User Experience**: Provide seamless event discovery, registration, and management
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure consistent event data with audit trails and backup systems
- **Scalability**: Support community growth from current size to 500+ active events annually
- **Compliance**: Maintain PCI compliance through external payment processors and data protection standards

### Success Metrics
- **API Performance**: <200ms response time for all event operations
- **Data Consistency**: 99.9% event data accuracy with zero data loss incidents
- **Integration Success**: 100% Demo UI functionality preserved with live data
- **User Adoption**: 95% of Event Organizers actively using the system within 30 days
- **System Reliability**: 99.5% uptime with automated failover capabilities
- **Security Compliance**: Zero data breaches and 100% PCI compliance maintenance

## Architecture Foundation Verification

**Verified no existing solution in:**
- `/docs/architecture/react-migration/domain-layer-architecture.md` - Checked: No existing Events API implementation
- `/docs/functional-areas/api-architecture-modernization/` - Confirmed: Vertical slice architecture for new endpoints
- `/docs/functional-areas/events/` - Verified: Demo UI complete, backend integration needed

**Domain Layer Architecture Compliance:**
- **CONFIRMED**: Follow vertical slice minimal API pattern established in API modernization
- **REQUIRED**: Use NSwag auto-generation for all TypeScript interfaces (no manual DTO creation)
- **ESTABLISHED**: Entity Framework services with direct DTO mapping for performance
