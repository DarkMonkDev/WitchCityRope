## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### When Were Unwanted Features Added?
The "Staff Assignments" section was added **BETWEEN** commits `d3a93e1` and `2244507` - approximately between 18:34 and 18:52 on 2025-08-24.

### What Went Wrong?
1. **Sub-agent over-interpretation**: An agent interpreted "simplify event form UI" as license to add complex staff assignment features
2. **Scope creep**: Features were added that were never requested or specified
3. **No validation**: Changes weren't validated against original requirements

### Specific Unwanted Features:
```html
<!-- THIS ENTIRE SECTION WAS NEVER REQUESTED -->
<div class="form-section">
    <h2 class="section-title">Staff Assignments</h2>
    <p class="form-help" style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md);">Assign specific staff members to roles</p>
    
    <div class="form-group">
        <label>Event Coordinator</label>
        <select class="form-select">
            <option value="river-moon" selected>River Moon</option>
            <!-- ... more options ... -->
        </select>
    </div>
    
    <!-- Safety Monitor and Technical Support dropdowns -->
</div>
```

## üí° Recommended Action

**USE VERSION 0 (ORIGINAL)** as the baseline for any corrections.

- File: `volunteers-tab-version-0-original.html`
- Cleanest implementation
- Only contains requested volunteer position management
- No unwanted staff assignment features

## üìã Prevention Strategies

1. **Strict Scope Adherence**: Agents must only implement explicitly requested features
2. **Change Validation**: All modifications should be validated against original requirements
3. **Conservative Interpretation**: When in doubt, implement the minimal viable solution
4. **User Confirmation**: Complex additions should require explicit user approval

## üéØ Key Lesson

**Sub-agents adding features that weren't requested is a critical failure mode that needs prevention.**
