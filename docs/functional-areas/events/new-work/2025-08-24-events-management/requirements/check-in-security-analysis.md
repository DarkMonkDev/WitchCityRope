## Executive Summary
The Events Management check-in screen faces a unique security challenge where admin users must safely hand off devices to non-admin front desk staff without compromising system security. This analysis presents three architectural solutions balancing security requirements with operational practicality.

## Security Challenge Context

### Current Workflow
1. **Admin Setup**: Event organizer logs into admin panel
2. **Screen Launch**: Admin launches check-in screen for specific event
3. **Device Handoff**: Admin provides device to front desk staff
4. **Event Operations**: Front desk staff uses check-in throughout event
5. **Security Risk**: Front desk staff could access admin functions if implementation is insecure

### Core Security Requirements
- **Privilege Isolation**: Front desk staff cannot access admin functions
- **Session Independence**: Check-in functionality persists despite admin logout
- **Data Access**: Check-in screen needs real-time attendee/membership data
- **Multi-Event Support**: Handle concurrent events with different check-in screens
- **Operational Simplicity**: Easy setup and handoff process for admins

## Proposed Solutions

## Solution 1: Scoped Authentication Tokens with Device Registration

### Approach
Create a specialized token-based system where admins generate limited-scope tokens specifically for check-in operations.

**Implementation Flow:**
1. Admin authenticates normally with full privileges
2. Admin selects event and generates "Check-In Token" with specific scope:
   - `checkin:event:{eventId}` permission only
   - 8-12 hour expiration (duration of typical event)
   - Device fingerprint binding for additional security
3. Check-in screen operates independently using scoped token
4. Token provides access only to check-in API endpoints for that specific event
5. Admin can revoke token remotely if needed

**Technical Components:**
- **Scoped JWT Claims**: Event-specific permissions in token payload
- **API Endpoint Filtering**: Middleware validates token scope against requested resources
- **Device Binding**: Token tied to browser/device fingerprint to prevent transfer
- **Independent Session**: Check-in screen doesn't depend on admin session state

### Pros
- **Strong Security**: Minimal privilege principle - token only grants check-in access
- **Session Independence**: Admin can logout without affecting check-in functionality
- **Audit Trail**: All check-in actions tied to specific scoped token for accountability
- **Multi-Event Support**: Different tokens for different events running simultaneously
- **Remote Control**: Admin can revoke specific tokens if device is compromised
- **Industry Standard**: JWT-based approach familiar to developers

### Cons
- **Token Management Complexity**: Need system for generating, storing, and revoking scoped tokens
- **Device Binding Challenges**: Browser fingerprinting has limitations and privacy concerns
- **Key Rotation**: Additional complexity for token signing key management
- **Debugging Difficulty**: More complex to troubleshoot token-related issues

### Implementation Considerations
- **Token Storage**: Store active check-in tokens in Redis with event association
- **API Design**: Dedicated `/api/checkin/*` endpoints that only accept scoped tokens
- **Frontend State**: Check-in screen stores token in memory (not localStorage for security)
- **Error Handling**: Clear messaging when tokens expire or are revoked
- **Performance**: Token validation adds slight latency to each check-in operation

### User Experience Impact
- **Admin Setup**: Additional step to generate check-in token (15-30 seconds)
- **Front Desk Staff**: Transparent - they just use the check-in screen normally
- **Error Recovery**: If token expires during event, admin must generate new token
- **Device Changes**: If device changes, new token generation required

## Solution 2: Dedicated Check-In User Accounts with Event Assignment

### Approach
Create special-purpose user accounts specifically for check-in operations, with temporary event assignments managed by admins.

**Implementation Flow:**
1. System maintains pool of "Check-In Staff" user accounts (e.g., checkin-station-1, checkin-station-2)
2. Admin logs in normally and assigns check-in account to specific event
3. Admin logs out and logs in as assigned check-in account
4. Check-in account has permissions only for assigned event check-in operations
5. After event, admin removes event assignment, disabling check-in account access

**Technical Components:**
- **Role-Based Access Control**: "CheckInStaff" role with very limited permissions
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Event assignments grant temporary access to specific event data
- **Account Management**: Admin interface to assign/unassign check-in accounts to events
- **Session Separation**: Check-in accounts completely separate from admin sessions

### Pros
- **Simple Architecture**: Leverages existing user authentication system
- **Clear Security Boundary**: Check-in accounts fundamentally cannot access admin functions
- **Familiar Pattern**: Standard user account model that team understands
- **Easy Troubleshooting**: Standard authentication flows and error patterns
- **Multiple Devices**: Same check-in account can be used on multiple devices if needed
- **Audit Trail**: All actions clearly associated with specific check-in account

### Cons
- **Account Overhead**: Need to maintain pool of check-in accounts
- **Admin Workflow**: Requires admin to log out of their account and log in as check-in account
- **Assignment Management**: Additional complexity for assigning accounts to events
- **Account Proliferation**: May need many check-in accounts for large events or concurrent events
- **Password Management**: Check-in accounts need secure but usable passwords

### Implementation Considerations
- **Account Pool Size**: Pre-create 5-10 check-in accounts (checkin-station-1 through checkin-station-10)
- **Permission Matrix**: CheckInStaff role can only access GET `/api/events/{eventId}/attendees` and POST `/api/events/{eventId}/checkin`
- **Assignment Logic**: Middleware validates that check-in account is assigned to requested event
- **Cleanup Process**: Automated job to remove expired event assignments
- **Password Strategy**: Use memorable but secure passwords, possibly with rotation schedule

### User Experience Impact
- **Admin Setup**: Must log out and log back in as different account (60-90 seconds)
- **Front Desk Staff**: May be confusing to see different account name in UI
- **Multi-Device**: Can potentially use same account on multiple check-in stations
- **Error Recovery**: If assignment expires, admin must reassign account to event

## Solution 3: Kiosk Mode with Admin-Generated Session Links

### Approach
Create a "kiosk mode" where the check-in screen runs as a public interface that validates against admin-generated session tokens embedded in URLs.

**Implementation Flow:**
1. Admin logs in and navigates to event management
2. Admin generates "Check-In Session Link" - special URL with embedded session token
3. Admin opens check-in screen using generated link (can be on same device or different device)
4. Check-in screen operates in "kiosk mode" with no user authentication required
5. Session link expires after event duration or manual revocation by admin
6. Screen shows minimal UI focused solely on check-in functionality

**Technical Components:**
- **Session Links**: Cryptographically secure URLs with embedded tokens: `/checkin?session={token}&event={eventId}`
- **Kiosk Mode UI**: Stripped-down interface with no admin navigation or user profile access
- **Anonymous Access**: Check-in screen doesn't require user to be logged in
- **Token Validation**: Each API call validates embedded session token for event access
- **Time-Based Security**: Links automatically expire after configurable duration

### Pros
- **No User Account Needed**: Front desk staff doesn't need any login credentials
- **Simple Handoff**: Admin just opens the link and hands device to staff
- **Multiple Devices**: Same link can be used on multiple devices simultaneously
- **Clean UI**: Kiosk mode provides focused, distraction-free interface
- **Easy Recovery**: If screen is accidentally closed, just reopen the link
- **Flexible Deployment**: Can be used on dedicated tablets, phones, or borrowed devices

### Cons
- **URL Security Risk**: Session token exposed in URL could be accidentally shared or logged
- **Link Management**: Need secure way to generate and manage session links
- **No User Context**: Harder to audit which specific person performed check-in actions
- **Browser Security**: Relies on browser security for token protection
- **Session Fixation**: Potential risks if URLs are shared or intercepted

### Implementation Considerations
- **Token Generation**: Use cryptographically secure random tokens with sufficient entropy
- **URL Structure**: Consider POST request with token in body instead of URL parameters
- **Browser History**: Implement history API manipulation to remove tokens from browser history
- **Link Expiration**: Default 12-hour expiration with admin control to extend or revoke early
- **Access Logging**: Enhanced logging since no user context for actions
- **UI Security**: Disable browser developer tools and right-click context menu in kiosk mode

### User Experience Impact
- **Admin Setup**: Quick link generation (10-15 seconds) and simple URL opening
- **Front Desk Staff**: Clean, focused interface with no login required
- **Device Flexibility**: Works on any device with web browser
- **Error Recovery**: Simple - just refresh or reopen the link
- **Multi-Station**: Easy to set up multiple check-in stations with same link
