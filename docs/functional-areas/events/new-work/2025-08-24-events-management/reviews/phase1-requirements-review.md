## Executive Summary

The Events Management System business requirements have been **completely revised** based on extensive user feedback and careful analysis of existing wireframes. The requirements now accurately reflect WitchCityRope's specific needs, corrected terminology, and leverage the "DAMN close to done" wireframes from the Blazor work.

3. **Teacher Role REMOVED**: No editing capabilities - contact Event Organizers for changes
4. **Automatic Refunds**: No admin approval needed within refund window
5. **Payment Options Planned**: Credit card, PayPal, and Venmo (future phases)
6. **Multi-Day Class Support**: Comprehensive solution for complex workshops
7. **Waitlist Included**: Phase 1 with automatic promotion
8. **Scale Adjusted**: Realistic 15 concurrent users
9. **Security Enhanced**: ZERO credit card storage, external processors only

### Business Value Highlights

- **Existing Assets**: Leverages wireframes that are 90% complete, saving weeks of design work
- **Community Alignment**: Properly reflects Salem rope bondage community terminology and workflows
- **Development Efficiency**: Clear Phase 1 scope with stubbed payments saves 3-4 weeks
- **Type Safety**: Zero DTO mismatches with NSwag auto-generation
- **User Experience**: Streamlined flows based on proven wireframe designs

## Critical Business Rules Captured

1. **Age Self-Reporting**: Users confirm 21+ during account creation (no verification)
2. **Vetting Requirements**: Social events restricted to vetted members only (can RSVP or purchase tickets)
3. **Capacity Management**: Classes based on purchased tickets, social events based on RSVPs
4. **Ticket Sales Cutoff**: Configurable per class event (default 2 hours before)
5. **Waitlist Logic**: Automatic promotion with configurable claim windows (24h, 48h, 8h, 4h)
6. **Teacher Permissions**: NO ACCESS - must contact Event Organizers for changes
7. **Event Organizer**: SIMPLIFIED ROLE - can create/manage ALL events
8. **Refund Windows**: Configurable per event (1, 2, or 4 days before event)
9. **Multi-Day Classes**: Support individual day tickets OR discounted series tickets
10. **Check-in Process**: By scene name/email lookup (no codes required)

## User Stories Priority Matrix

### Phase 1 - Must Have
1. **US-001**: Admin creates new event (P0 - Critical)
2. **US-002**: Member browses and registers for class (P0 - Critical)
3. **US-003**: Vetted member RSVPs for social event (P0 - Critical)
4. **US-004**: Admin manages event check-in (P1 - High)
5. **US-005**: Member views registered events (P1 - High)

### Phase 2+ - Nice to Have
6. **US-006**: System processes payments (P2 - Stubbed)
7. **US-007**: System sends email notifications (P2 - Stubbed)
8. **US-008**: Admin views analytics (P3 - Future)

## Architecture Alignment Verification

### ‚úÖ DTO Strategy Compliance
- All data structures specified for NSwag auto-generation
- No manual TypeScript interfaces defined
- Backend DTOs will be source of truth
- Type generation pipeline ready

### ‚úÖ Technology Stack Alignment
- React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.2.2
- Mantine v7 component usage planned
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- Zustand for state management

### ‚úÖ Security Implementation
- JWT + httpOnly cookies authentication
- Role-based access control
- CSRF protection for mutations
- XSS prevention with React

## Risk Assessment Summary

### High Risks
1. **Data Migration**: Events from old system need careful migration
   - *Mitigation*: Phased migration with validation scripts

### Medium Risks  
2. **Payment Stubbing**: May confuse users if not clearly communicated
   - *Mitigation*: Clear UI indicators that payment is simulated
3. **Performance with Large Event Lists**: Potential slowdown with 100+ events
   - *Mitigation*: Virtual scrolling, pagination, caching

### Low Risks
4. **Browser Compatibility**: Older browsers may have issues
   - *Mitigation*: Progressive enhancement, polyfills

## Questions Requiring Product Decision

### üî¥ Decisions Now Resolved

Based on user feedback, the following decisions have been made:

1. **Phase Timeline**: "As long as it takes" - no artificial deadlines
2. **Email Integration**: Phase 2 with SendGrid (before payment integration)
3. **Payment Integration**: Phase 3 (after email notifications work)
4. **Waitlist**: INCLUDED in Phase 1 with configurable claim windows
5. **Deployment**: Full site rollout at once (no feature flags)
6. **Data Migration**: None needed (no existing Blazor implementation)

### üü° Remaining Questions

1. **Multi-Day Class Complexity**:
   - Full implementation in Phase 1 (complex but complete)?
   - Simplified version initially (basic series support)?
   - **Recommendation**: Simplified Phase 1, full complexity Phase 2

2. **Volunteer Discount Configuration**:
   - Fixed percentage discount?
   - Configurable per event?
   - **Recommendation**: Configurable per event (10%, 25%, 50%, 100% options)

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Targets (Updated for Realistic Scale)
- Page load time: <200ms 
- Time to create event: <2 minutes
- Ticket purchase completion: <30 seconds
- RSVP completion: <10 seconds
- Support 15 concurrent users smoothly
- Handle 10 active events with 500 total tickets/RSVPs
- Mobile performance score: >90
- Type safety: 100% (NSwag generated)

### Qualitative Goals
- Intuitive navigation aligned with existing wireframes
- Proper terminology (no "registration" confusion)
- Clear vetted member vs general member experiences
- Seamless multi-day class ticket options
- Accessible check-in without codes
