- **Add Real Data**: Focus on connecting existing components to real APIs
- **Maintain Design Compliance**: Demo already follows wireframe specifications

### 2. Follow Documented Architecture
- **API Endpoints**: Use specifications from functional-design.md exactly
- **Database Schema**: Implement documented entity relationships
- **Business Rules**: All logic is pre-defined in business requirements

### 3. Leverage Test Coverage Plan
- **Use Existing Test Specs**: Test coverage document has complete test plans
- **Playwright Tests**: E2E tests are already implemented for demo UI
- **Integration Testing**: Follow documented integration test patterns

### 4. Reference Implementation Path
1. **Read**: `/docs/functional-areas/events/new-work/2025-08-24-events-management/requirements/backend-integration-requirements.md`
2. **Implement**: API endpoints per functional-design.md specifications
3. **Connect**: Demo UI components to real data sources
4. **Test**: Using existing Playwright test suite with real data
5. **Deploy**: Following documented deployment patterns

## Conclusion

WitchCityRope has an exceptionally complete Events system design with:
- ✅ **Complete demo UI implementation** (all 4 tabs functional)
- ✅ **Comprehensive business requirements** (2 detailed documents)
- ✅ **Full technical specifications** (API, database, architecture)
- ✅ **Interactive wireframes** (public, admin, check-in interfaces)
- ✅ **User flow documentation** (complete journey mapping)
- ✅ **Test coverage strategy** (unit, integration, E2E specifications)
- ✅ **Design system integration** (colors, typography, components)

**The implementation team should NOT reinvent anything. All designs, specifications, and patterns exist and should be used exactly as documented.**

**Next Step**: Begin backend API development using the comprehensive specifications in backend-integration-requirements.md to connect the existing demo UI to real data.
