# Requirements Clarifications for Events Management Implementation

<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-07 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Active -->

## Purpose
This document captures the specific implementation decisions made during the requirements clarification process. These decisions are binding for the implementation team to ensure consistent development across all phases.

## Business Logic Clarifications

### 1. Ticket Pricing Policy
**Decision**: NO difference between member/non-member pricing
- Remove any member/non-member price differentiation from requirements
- Simplify pricing model to single price per ticket type
- Impact: Reduces complexity in checkout flow and database schema

### 2. Capacity Management for Multi-Session Events
**Decision**: Multi-session tickets reduce capacity by 1 for EACH session
- A ticket that covers 3 sessions reduces available capacity by 1 for each of those 3 sessions
- Example: 100-capacity event with 3 sessions, 1 multi-session ticket sold = 99 remaining capacity for each session
- Impact: Requires session-specific capacity tracking in database

### 3. Cancellation Policy Structure
**Decision**: Time-based cancellation policy with configurable options
- Available options: 24 hours, 48 hours, 3 days, or 4 days before event
- Policy applies per event and can be configured by event organizers
- Impact: Requires cancellation deadline field in event schema

### 4. Waitlist Management Logic
**Decision**: Automatic promotion with configurable timing
- System automatically promotes from waitlist when capacity becomes available
- Configurable promotion timing settings for event organizers
- Impact: Requires background job system for automatic promotions

## Technical Integration Decisions

### 5. Payment Processing Integration
**Decision**: PayPal and Venmo support required
- Primary payment methods: PayPal, Venmo
- Google Pay: Nice-to-have but NOT required for this implementation phase
- Impact: Focus development effort on PayPal and Venmo APIs only

### 6. Email Notification Service
**Decision**: SendGrid for email notifications
- Use SendGrid API for all event-related email communications
- Includes: registration confirmations, cancellation notices, waitlist promotions
- Impact: Requires SendGrid API integration and template management

### 7. File Upload Storage Strategy
**Decision**: Local storage for current phase
- Event documents, images, and attachments stored locally
- Cloud storage migration planned for future phase
- Impact: Implement local file management with future cloud migration path

## UX and Technical Priorities

### 8. Mobile-First Development Approach
**Decision**: Yes, prioritize mobile experience first
- Design and implement mobile layouts first, then adapt for desktop
- Mobile breakpoints take precedence in responsive design decisions
- Impact: Mobile-optimized component library and layout patterns required

### 9. Accessibility Compliance
**Decision**: Fully compliant accessibility required
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory for all event management features
- Screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation support
- Impact: Additional development time for accessibility testing and implementation

### 10. Internationalization Support
**Decision**: English only for initial implementation
- No multi-language support required for this phase
- Future internationalization support may be added later
- Impact: Simplified implementation without i18n complexity

### 11. Browser Support Strategy
**Decision**: Modern browsers only
- Support latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- No Internet Explorer or legacy browser support required
- Impact: Can use modern JavaScript/CSS features without polyfills

## Implementation Impact Summary

### Database Schema Requirements
- Event capacity tracking per session
- Cancellation policy configuration fields
- Payment method preference settings
- File upload metadata storage

### API Development Requirements
- PayPal and Venmo payment integration endpoints
- SendGrid email notification service
- Session capacity management logic
- Automatic waitlist promotion background jobs

### Frontend Development Requirements
- Mobile-first responsive design patterns
- Accessibility-compliant UI components
- Local file upload handling
- Payment flow integration (PayPal/Venmo only)

### Testing Requirements
- Mobile device testing prioritization
- Accessibility compliance validation
- Payment integration testing (PayPal/Venmo)
- Multi-session capacity logic verification

## Change Control Process

Any modifications to these requirements must:
1. Be documented in this file with date and rationale
2. Be communicated to all development teams
3. Include impact assessment on existing work
4. Receive approval from business stakeholder

## Next Steps

Implementation teams should:
1. Review these clarifications before beginning development
2. Update technical specifications to reflect these decisions
3. Ensure database schema includes all required fields
4. Plan development phases based on these priorities
