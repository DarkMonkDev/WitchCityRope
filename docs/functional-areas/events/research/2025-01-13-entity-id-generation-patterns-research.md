<!-- Status: ACTIVE -->

## Executive Summary
**Decision Required**: How to handle temporary entity identification when adding new child entities (like sessions to an event) in React forms before saving to the .NET API.
**Recommendation**: Client-Generated UUIDs with Server Replacement Pattern (Confidence: 90%)
**Key Factors**: Developer Experience, Type Safety via NSwag, Optimistic Updates Support

## Research Scope
### Requirements
- Handle new child entities (event sessions) in React forms before persistence
- Maintain referential integrity in UI state during form editing
- Support optimistic updates with TanStack Query
- Integrate seamlessly with NSwag-generated TypeScript types
- Work within WitchCityRope's security and architecture constraints

### Success Criteria
- Clear, predictable ID handling across all CRUD scenarios
- Zero type conflicts with NSwag-generated interfaces
- Optimal user experience with immediate UI feedback
- Maintainable pattern for all parent-child relationships
- Compatible with existing authentication and validation architecture

### Out of Scope
- Complex multi-level nesting (beyond parent-child)
- Offline-first synchronization patterns
- Real-time collaborative editing scenarios

## Technology Options Evaluated

### Option 1: Client-Generated UUIDs with Server Replacement
**Overview**: Frontend generates UUID v4 for new entities, API replaces with server IDs on save
**Version Evaluated**: React crypto.randomUUID() API + C# Guid.NewGuid()
**Documentation Quality**: Excellent (MDN, Microsoft Learn)

**Pros**:
- **Stable React Keys**: UUIDs provide consistent keys for React list rendering
- **Type Safety**: Works seamlessly with NSwag-generated Guid types
- **Optimistic Updates**: Perfect for TanStack Query's optimistic patterns
- **No Conflicts**: Near-zero chance of client/server ID collision
- **Accessibility**: Stable IDs for form element relationships (aria-describedby)
- **Developer Experience**: Clear distinction between client-generated and server IDs

**Cons**:
- **UUID Overhead**: 36-character strings vs 4-byte integers for network payload
- **Browser Support**: crypto.randomUUID() requires polyfill for older browsers
- **Complexity**: Requires mapping logic between client UUID and server GUID
- **Debug Complexity**: Non-sequential IDs harder to track in development logs

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- Safety/Privacy: Excellent - no predictable ID patterns
- Mobile Experience: Good - UUIDs work well across all devices
- Learning Curve: Low - familiar pattern for React developers
- Community Values: Excellent - secure, non-enumerable identifiers

### Option 2: Negative Integer Temporary IDs
**Overview**: Use negative integers for new entities, server returns positive IDs
**Version Evaluated**: JavaScript Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER pattern
**Documentation Quality**: Good (Stack Overflow patterns, Redux Toolkit examples)

**Pros**:
- **Performance**: Smallest payload size (4-8 bytes vs 36 characters)
- **Simple Logic**: Easy increment/decrement for ID generation
- **Debug Friendly**: Sequential IDs easier to trace in development
- **No Dependencies**: Works with any JavaScript environment
- **Clear Distinction**: Negative vs positive clearly separates temporary vs persisted

**Cons**:
- **Type Mismatch**: .NET API expects Guid, but negative ints are numbers
- **NSwag Conflict**: Generated TypeScript interfaces expect string (Guid), not number
- **Race Conditions**: Multiple components generating negative IDs could conflict
- **Limited Range**: Eventually exhausts negative integer space
- **Accessibility Issues**: Numeric IDs don't work well with HTML id attributes

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- Safety/Privacy: Poor - predictable sequential patterns
- Mobile Experience: Excellent - minimal bandwidth usage
- Learning Curve: Medium - requires custom ID generation strategy
- Community Values: Poor - potentially enumerable user data

### Option 3: Optimistic UI-Only Pattern (No Temporary IDs)
**Overview**: Render unsaved entities without IDs, rely only on array indices
**Version Evaluated**: TanStack Query variables-based rendering
**Documentation Quality**: Good (TanStack Query official docs)

**Pros**:
- **Simplicity**: No ID generation logic required
- **Direct Rendering**: Uses mutation variables directly in UI
- **No Mapping**: No client-to-server ID replacement needed
- **Performance**: Zero overhead for ID generation or tracking
- **Type Safety**: No temporary ID type conflicts

**Cons**:
- **React Key Issues**: Array indices are unstable keys for React rendering
- **Accessibility Problems**: Cannot link form labels to inputs without stable IDs
- **State Management**: Difficult to track specific unsaved entities
- **Update Complexity**: Hard to handle partial updates to unsaved entities
- **User Experience**: No way to validate or edit specific unsaved items

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- Safety/Privacy: Excellent - no ID tracking
- Mobile Experience: Excellent - minimal memory usage
- Learning Curve: Low - straightforward React patterns
- Community Values: Poor - accessibility and usability concerns

## Implementation Considerations

### Migration Path
1. **Phase 1**: Implement UUID generation utility and type definitions
2. **Phase 2**: Create TanStack Query mutation patterns with optimistic updates
3. **Phase 3**: Implement server-side UUID-to-GUID mapping in .NET API
4. **Phase 4**: Test and validate across all parent-child scenarios
5. **Phase 5**: Document patterns for team adoption

**Estimated effort**: 2-3 development days
**Risk mitigation**: Implement in isolated component first, then scale

### Integration Points
- **NSwag Types**: Generated interfaces already support Guid (string) type
- **TanStack Query**: Mutation onSuccess handlers replace client UUID with server GUID
- **React Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation with UUID field validation
- **API Endpoints**: Minimal changes - accept UUID in request, return GUID in response
- **Database**: No changes required - EF Core generates GUIDs as normal

### Performance Impact
- **Bundle Size**: +1.2KB for UUID polyfill (modern browsers: 0KB)
- **Runtime Memory**: +36 bytes per temporary entity vs +4 bytes for negative IDs
- **Network Payload**: +32 bytes per entity vs negative IDs (minimal for event sessions)
- **CPU Impact**: crypto.randomUUID() is optimized, negligible performance cost

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: crypto.randomUUID() not available in older browsers
  - **Mitigation**: Implement polyfill using crypto.getRandomValues() + UUID formatting

### Medium Risk
- **Memory Usage**: Large forms with many temporary entities could impact memory
  - **Mitigation**: Clean up temporary entities on form reset/cancel

### Low Risk
- **Network Overhead**: UUID strings larger than integer IDs
  - **Monitoring**: Track payload sizes; acceptable increase for security benefits

## Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: Client-Generated UUIDs with Server Replacement
**Confidence Level**: High (90%)

**Rationale**:
1. **Perfect NSwag Integration**: Generated TypeScript interfaces expect Guid (string), UUIDs are strings - zero type conflicts
2. **Optimal React Patterns**: Stable keys for list rendering, reliable IDs for accessibility attributes
3. **TanStack Query Synergy**: UUID pattern designed for optimistic updates and server replacement
4. **Security Alignment**: Non-enumerable IDs align with WitchCityRope's security requirements
5. **Future-Proof**: Scales to any parent-child relationship across the application

**Implementation Priority**: Immediate - needed for event session management

### Alternative Recommendations
- **Second Choice**: UI-Only Pattern - Simple but limited accessibility
- **Future Consideration**: Negative IDs - Only if network performance becomes critical

## Next Steps
