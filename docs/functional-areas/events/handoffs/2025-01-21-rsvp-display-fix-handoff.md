# RSVP/Ticket Display Fix Handoff - 2025-01-21

**Agent**: React Developer
**Date**: 2025-01-21
**Task**: Fix broken RSVP/ticket display issues across admin and user interfaces

## Summary

Fixed critical field mapping bug that was causing all RSVP/ticket counts to display as zero throughout the application, despite real data existing in the API.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Admin Events List Capacity Column ✅
- **Problem**: Showing 0/X for all events instead of real RSVP/ticket counts
- **Root Cause**: Field mapping utility consolidating to non-existent `registrationCount` field
- **Fix**: Preserve individual API fields `currentRSVPs`, `currentTickets`, `currentAttendees`

### 2. Admin Event Details RSVP Tab ✅
- **Status**: Already properly implemented with `useEventParticipations` hook
- **Note**: Was working correctly - issue was upstream in field mapping

### 3. User Dashboard Participation Count ✅
- **Status**: Uses separate hook (`useUserParticipations`) with proper fallback for missing API
- **Note**: Will display correctly once individual API endpoints are implemented

## Files Modified

### `/apps/web/src/utils/eventFieldMapping.ts`
**CRITICAL FIX**: Changed field mapping to preserve API structure

```typescript
// Before (BROKEN)
import type { EventDto } from '../lib/api/types/events.types';
registrationCount: apiEvent.currentAttendees || apiEvent.currentRSVPs || apiEvent.currentTickets || 0,

// After (FIXED)
import type { EventDto } from '@witchcityrope/shared-types';
currentAttendees: apiEvent.currentAttendees,
currentRSVPs: apiEvent.currentRSVPs,
currentTickets: apiEvent.currentTickets,
```

## Verification Results

### API Response Confirmed ✅
- Event API returns proper structure with individual count fields
- Social event example: `"currentRSVPs": 2, "currentTickets": 0`
- Class events use `currentTickets` for paid tickets

### Component Pattern Confirmed ✅
- `EventsTableView` already uses correct `getCorrectCurrentCount()` helper
- Follows established pattern from lessons learned
- Will now receive correct data after field mapping fix

## Testing Status

- ✅ **TypeScript Build**: Passes without errors
- ✅ **API Response**: Confirmed correct data structure
- ✅ **Field Mapping**: Fixed to preserve API fields
- ⏳ **Browser Testing**: Requires containers running for full verification

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Start development environment** (`./dev.sh`)
2. **Navigate to admin events list** (`/admin/events`)
3. **Verify capacity column** shows real counts (not 0/X)
4. **Test admin event details** RSVP/Tickets tab shows real data
5. **Test with admin login** to verify all admin-only features

## API Endpoints Status

- ✅ `GET /api/events` - Working, returns correct data structure
- ⏳ `GET /api/admin/events/{id}/participations` - Requires authentication testing
- ⏳ `DELETE /api/events/{id}/rsvp` - Cancel RSVP endpoint status unknown

## Lessons Learned Added

Added new critical lesson to prevent future field mapping issues:
- **Location**: `/docs/lessons-learned/react-developer-lessons-learned.md`
- **Topic**: Event field mapping with shared types
- **Includes**: Correct patterns, verification steps, consequences

## Dependencies

- ✅ **Shared Types Package**: Must use `@witchcityrope/shared-types` for EventDto
- ✅ **API Contract**: Relies on API returning individual count fields
- ✅ **Component Pattern**: Uses established `getCorrectCurrentCount()` helper

## Handoff Notes

This fix resolves the core data issue. All UI components were already correctly implemented - they were just receiving zeroed data due to the mapping bug. After this fix:

1. **Admin events table** will show real participation counts
2. **Admin event details** will show actual RSVP/ticket data
3. **Capacity displays** will show accurate current/max values
4. **User dashboards** will show correct participation when API endpoints are added

The Cancel RSVP button functionality should be tested next, but the display issues are now resolved.
