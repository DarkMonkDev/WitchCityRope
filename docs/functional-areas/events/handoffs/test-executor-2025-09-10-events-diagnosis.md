# Test Executor Events Diagnosis - 2025-09-10

**Agent**: test-executor  
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Time**: 03:22:00 UTC  
**Session Type**: Focused Diagnostic Testing  
**Priority**: CRITICAL - User Issue Diagnosis  

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING: Events Are NOT Displaying Due to API Connection Issues

### Executive Summary

**REALITY CHECK COMPLETE**: After multiple "fixes" were applied, I ran a focused diagnostic test to see what's ACTUALLY happening on the events page. The user report was CORRECT - events are not displaying.

**Root Cause Identified**: The React frontend cannot connect to the API backend due to **port mismatch and connection issues**.

**Status**: 
- ‚úÖ Frontend UI: Professional and working correctly with proper error handling
- ‚ùå API Connection: COMPLETELY BROKEN - ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
- ‚ùå Events Display: NOT WORKING - User sees error message

## Test Execution Results

### Environment Status
```bash
Docker Containers:
- witchcity-web: Up 5 minutes (unhealthy) 
- witchcity-api: Up 2 hours (healthy)
- witchcity-postgres: Up 2 hours (healthy)

API Direct Test:
- curl http://localhost:5653/health ‚Üí CONNECTION REFUSED
- curl http://localhost:5173/api/events ‚Üí Working (returns proper JSON with 6 events)
```

### What The User Actually Sees

**Screenshot Evidence**: 
1. **Initial Load**: Page shows loading skeleton with gray placeholder cards
2. **After API Timeout**: Clear error message "Failed to Load Events - Unable to load events. Please check your connection and try again."

**User Experience**: 
- Navigates to /events ‚Üí Sees professional layout
- Page attempts to load events ‚Üí Shows loading state  
- API calls fail ‚Üí Error message displays
- **NO EVENTS VISIBLE TO USER**

### Diagnostic Test Results

**Network Analysis**:
```
API Request Pattern: Frontend ‚Üí http://localhost:5653/api/events
Result: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED (every attempt)
Browser Console: "API Error: GET /api/events {status: undefined, statusText: undefined, data: undefined}"
Retry Behavior: Attempts every 2 seconds, all failing
```

**DOM Analysis**:
- Elements with data-testid containing "event": 3 (placeholder elements)
- Event-specific content: NONE FOUND
- Page contains "Events": TRUE (header text)
- Page contains actual event titles: FALSE
- Error handling: WORKING (shows proper error message)

**Visual Evidence**:
- Professional WitchCity Rope branding ‚úÖ
- Proper navigation structure ‚úÖ  
- Loading states implemented correctly ‚úÖ
- Error message clear and user-friendly ‚úÖ
- **ZERO actual event data displayed** ‚ùå

## Root Cause Analysis

### The REAL Problem

**API Connection Issue**: The React frontend is configured to call `http://localhost:5653/api/events` but this port is not accessible.

**Evidence**:
1. **Direct API Test**: `curl http://localhost:5653/health` ‚Üí CONNECTION REFUSED
2. **Proxy Working**: `curl http://localhost:5173/api/events` ‚Üí Returns 6 events properly
3. **Frontend Configuration**: Attempting direct API calls instead of using dev proxy

### Why Previous "Fixes" Didn't Work

**Previous Assumptions**: 
- "API wrapper was wrong format" ‚úÖ FIXED but not the core issue
- "Data wasn't being returned" ‚ùå INCORRECT - data is available via proxy
- "Frontend wasn't handling responses" ‚ùå INCORRECT - error handling works perfectly

**Actual Issue**: Frontend API client is bypassing the working development proxy and attempting direct connection to unavailable API port.

## Technical Evidence

### API Response Format (Working via Proxy)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "70703211-b930-418a-87ac-b4547a691577",
      "title": "Rope Fundamentals: Floor Work", 
      "description": "Master the basics of floor-based rope bondage...",
      "startDate": "2025-09-12T17:16:55.607051Z",
      "location": "The Rope Space - Main Room"
    },
    // ... 5 more events
  ],
  "error": null,
  "message": "Events retrieved successfully",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-10T03:21:24.4025031Z"
}
```

### Frontend Error Pattern
```typescript
// Browser Console Output:
API Error: GET /api/events {status: undefined, statusText: undefined, data: undefined}
Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
```

## User Impact Assessment

**Current User Experience**: 
1. User navigates to events page
2. Sees professional loading state (good UX)
3. After timeout, sees error: "Failed to Load Events"
4. **User cannot see any events** (CRITICAL ISSUE)
5. User must "check connection and try again" (not helpful - it's a config issue)

**Business Impact**:
- Users cannot discover events ‚ùå
- Users cannot register for classes ‚ùå  
- Community engagement blocked ‚ùå
- Professional appearance maintained ‚úÖ

## Required Fix

### IMMEDIATE Action Needed (React Developer)

**Problem**: Frontend API client configuration is not using the development proxy correctly.

**Current Behavior**: 
```
Frontend ‚Üí http://localhost:5653/api/events ‚Üí CONNECTION REFUSED
```

**Required Behavior**:
```
Frontend ‚Üí http://localhost:5173/api/events ‚Üí Proxy ‚Üí API ‚Üí SUCCESS
```

**Specific Investigation Areas**:
1. Check `/src/api/client.ts` or similar API configuration
2. Verify baseURL configuration in API client
3. Ensure development proxy is being used instead of direct API calls
4. Test that client uses relative URLs (`/api/events`) instead of absolute URLs

**Expected Result**: Events display immediately without any backend changes required.

## Testing Validation

### Pre-Fix State (CONFIRMED)
- [x] Professional UI renders correctly
- [x] Loading states work properly  
- [x] Error handling displays appropriate messages
- [x] API data is available via proxy (`/api/events` returns 6 events)
- [x] Direct API port is inaccessible (`5653` connection refused)
- [x] **User sees NO events** (CRITICAL ISSUE CONFIRMED)

### Post-Fix Validation Required
- [ ] Frontend uses proxy for API calls
- [ ] Events page displays all 6 events
- [ ] Event cards show titles, descriptions, dates, locations
- [ ] No connection error messages
- [ ] Proper loading ‚Üí success state transition

## Evidence Files

**Screenshots Captured**:
- `/test-results/events-page-actual-diagnosis.png` - Shows loading skeleton state
- `/test-results/events-page-after-wait.png` - Shows final error message
- `/test-results/events-main-content.png` - Content area detail

**Test File Created**:
- `/tests/playwright/events-diagnostic.spec.ts` - Comprehensive diagnostic test for future validation

## Development Priority

**CRITICAL**: This is a user-blocking issue. Multiple "fixes" have been attempted but the core problem (API connection configuration) was not addressed.

**Time Estimate**: 30-60 minutes for React developer to:
1. Identify API client configuration issue
2. Fix baseURL or proxy usage
3. Verify events display correctly
4. Confirm fix with diagnostic test

## Handoff Instructions

**Next Agent**: react-developer  
**Task**: Fix frontend API client to use development proxy instead of direct API connection  
**Validation**: Run `/tests/playwright/events-diagnostic.spec.ts` to confirm events display  
**Success Criteria**: User can see all 6 events with titles, descriptions, dates, and locations  

## Lessons Learned

1. **Visual Evidence is Critical**: Screenshots revealed the exact user experience vs assumptions
2. **Test Both Direct API and Proxy**: Development environment has two ways to access API
3. **Don't Trust "It Should Work" Reports**: Always validate actual user experience
4. **Error Messages Guide Diagnosis**: "Connection refused" pointed to port/connectivity issue
5. **Frontend Error Handling Can Mask Config Issues**: Professional error display hid the real problem

---

**BOTTOM LINE**: The user was RIGHT - events are not displaying. The issue is frontend API configuration, not backend data format or availability. One configuration fix will resolve this completely.
