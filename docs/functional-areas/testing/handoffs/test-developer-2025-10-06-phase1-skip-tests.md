# Test Developer Handoff - Phase 1 Task 1: Mark Unimplemented Features

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Baseline + Quick Wins
**Task**: Mark Category B tests (unimplemented features) with `test.skip()` and TODO comments
**Agent**: test-developer
**Status**: COMPLETE

---

## Task Summary

Identified and marked **5 E2E tests** testing unimplemented features with `test.skip()` and TODO comments explaining why they are skipped and when to unskip them.

---

## Tests Marked as Skipped

### File: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web/tests/playwright/events-comprehensive.spec.ts`

#### 1. Event Detail Modal/View (Line 37)
```typescript
// TODO: Unskip when event detail modal/view is implemented
// Feature does not exist yet - event cards are not clickable to show details
test.skip('should display event details when clicking event card', ...)
```

**Reason for skip**: Event cards are not clickable and there is no event detail modal or detail page component implemented yet.

**When to unskip**: When event cards become clickable and either:
- Event detail modal is implemented, OR
- Event detail page navigation is implemented

---

#### 2. Event Type Filtering (Line 68)
```typescript
// TODO: Unskip when event type filtering is implemented
// Feature not implemented - event filter controls don't exist yet
test.skip('should filter events by type', ...)
```

**Reason for skip**: Event filter controls (dropdowns, buttons) for filtering by event type (Class, Workshop, Social, etc.) are not implemented.

**When to unskip**: When filter controls are added to the events page UI (e.g., `[data-testid="event-type-filter"]` or similar)

---

#### 3. Event RSVP/Ticket Options in Detail View (Line 191)
```typescript
// TODO: Unskip when event detail view with RSVP/ticket buttons is implemented
// Feature incomplete - event cards not clickable and RSVP buttons not in event detail view
test.skip('should show event RSVP/ticket options for authenticated users', ...)
```

**Reason for skip**: Combination of two unimplemented features:
1. Event cards not clickable (no detail view access)
2. RSVP/ticket purchase buttons not present in event detail view

**When to unskip**: When both:
- Event detail view is accessible (modal or page)
- RSVP/ticket buttons (`[data-testid="button-rsvp"]`, `[data-testid="button-purchase-ticket"]`) are present in detail view

---

#### 4. RSVP/Ticket Purchase Flow (Line 295)
```typescript
// TODO: Unskip when full RSVP/ticket purchase flow is implemented
// Feature incomplete - RSVP flow not fully implemented per test logs
test.skip('should handle event RSVP/ticket purchase flow', ...)
```

**Reason for skip**: Full RSVP/ticket purchase workflow is not implemented. Test logs from Oct 5 analysis acknowledge "RSVP functionality not fully implemented".

**When to unskip**: When the complete flow is implemented:
1. RSVP/ticket button clickable
2. RSVP/ticket form or modal displays
3. Confirmation flow completes
4. RSVP/ticket appears in user dashboard

---

#### 5. Parallel RSVP and Ticket Purchase (Line 367)
```typescript
// TODO: Unskip when parallel RSVP/ticket purchase actions are implemented
// Feature not implemented - social events don't yet show both RSVP and ticket purchase as parallel options
test.skip('social event should offer RSVP AND ticket purchase as parallel actions', ...)
```

**Reason for skip**: Social events do not yet support showing both RSVP (free) and ticket purchase (paid) as **separate, parallel actions**. This is a specific business requirement where users can:
- RSVP only (free)
- Buy ticket only (paid, auto-creates RSVP)
- Do both

**When to unskip**: When social events show both buttons simultaneously:
- `[data-testid="button-rsvp"]` AND
- `[data-testid="button-purchase-ticket"]`
- As separate, independent actions (not conditional)

---

## Tests Already Properly Skipped

### File: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web/src/components/events/__tests__/EventSessionForm.test.tsx`

**Line 12**: Entire test suite already marked with `describe.skip()`

```typescript
describe.skip('EventSessionForm', () => {
  // 10 test cases for event session matrix form components
});
```

**Reason**: EventSessionForm component for managing event sessions, ticket types, and capacity calculations is not yet implemented. This is a complex form for multi-session events.

**When to unskip**: When EventSessionForm component is created and basic rendering works.

**Test count**: ~40+ individual assertions across 10 test cases

---

## Tests NOT Skipped

### VettingApplicationsList Tests
**Decision**: NOT marked as skipped

**Reason**: Initial analysis suggested "No vetting applications found" message might not exist, but investigation revealed:
- VettingApplicationsList component EXISTS at `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web/src/features/admin/vetting/components/VettingApplicationsList.tsx`
- Empty state message "No vetting applications found" EXISTS on line 369
- All 17 test cases in `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web/src/features/admin/vetting/components/__tests__/VettingApplicationsList.test.tsx` test IMPLEMENTED features

**Tests validated**:
- Table rendering with columns
- Search functionality
- Status filtering
- Sorting
- Pagination
- Bulk selection
- Navigation to detail
- Loading/error/empty states ← ALL IMPLEMENTED

---

## Impact Analysis

### Tests Skipped Summary
- **E2E Tests**: 5 tests in `events-comprehensive.spec.ts`
- **React Unit Tests**: 0 tests (EventSessionForm already skipped correctly)
- **Total newly marked**: 5 tests

### Expected Pass Rate Improvement
**Before Phase 1 Task 1**:
- E2E Events Comprehensive: 57% pass rate (8/14 passed)

**After Phase 1 Task 1**:
- E2E Events Comprehensive: **~86% pass rate** (8/9 non-skipped tests passing)
- 5 tests now properly categorized as "skipped due to unimplemented features"

### Files Modified
1. `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web/tests/playwright/events-comprehensive.spec.ts`
   - 5 tests marked with `test.skip()`
   - All tests include TODO comments explaining when to unskip
   - Comments explain what feature is missing

---

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Verify Tests Compile
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web
npm run type-check
```

**Expected**: No TypeScript errors in test files

### Step 2: Run Skipped Test File
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/tests/playwright
npx playwright test events-comprehensive.spec.ts --reporter=list
```

**Expected output**:
- 5 tests show as "skipped" (not "failed")
- Remaining tests in file run normally
- No test.skip() compilation errors

### Step 3: Verify Skip Count
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web/tests/playwright
grep -n "test.skip" events-comprehensive.spec.ts
```

**Expected**: 5 matches at lines 37, 68, 191, 295, 367

---

## Next Steps

### For Phase 1 Continuation
1. ✅ **Task 1 COMPLETE**: Mark unimplemented features with `test.skip()`
2. ⏳ **Task 2 PENDING**: Fix easy Category C selector updates (~10-15 tests)
3. ⏳ **Task 3 PENDING**: Fix Category D infrastructure issues (2 tests)

### For Feature Implementation
When features are implemented, search for TODO comments and unskip tests:
```bash
# Find all skipped tests with TODO
grep -rn "// TODO: Unskip" apps/web/tests/playwright/

# Find specific feature
grep -rn "TODO: Unskip when event detail" apps/web/tests/playwright/
```

---

## Important Notes

### Why These Tests Were Skipped, Not Deleted
1. **Document Expected Behavior**: Tests serve as specifications for unimplemented features
2. **Prevent Regression**: When features are added, tests ensure they work correctly
3. **Track Progress**: Skipped tests show what features remain to be built
4. **No False Failures**: Tests no longer fail because of missing features (reduces noise)

### Category B vs Category A Distinction
- **Category B (Skipped)**: Feature DOES NOT EXIST yet (no component, no UI element)
- **Category A (Not Skipped)**: Feature EXISTS but HAS BUGS (component exists, behavior broken)

**Example**:
- ✅ **Category B**: Event detail modal (modal component doesn't exist) → SKIP
- ❌ **Category A**: Login error handling (login exists, error handling broken) → FIX BUG

### Skipping Strategy
Only skipped tests where:
1. **Feature clearly doesn't exist** (no UI elements, no component)
2. **Oct 5 analysis confirmed** feature incomplete
3. **Test logs showed** graceful handling of missing feature

Did NOT skip tests where:
- Feature might exist but test selectors are wrong (Category C - outdated tests)
- Feature exists but backend is broken (Category A - legitimate bugs)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **All criteria met**:
- ✅ ~5 tests marked with `test.skip()` (5 E2E tests)
- ✅ All skipped tests have TODO comments explaining why
- ✅ Handoff document created listing all changes
- ✅ No production code modified (only test files changed)
- ✅ Tests still compile successfully
