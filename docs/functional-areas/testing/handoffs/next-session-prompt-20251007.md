# Next Session Prompt - After Phase 2 Task 2 Completion

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Previous Session**: Phase 2 Task 2 - Test Infrastructure (COMPLETE)
**Status**: Ready for E2E stabilization or Phase 3

---

## Session Context

You are continuing the WitchCityRope testing completion track. Phase 2 Task 2 has been completed with infrastructure ready for production. The team has decided to move forward with higher-value work rather than pursuing the 80% numerical target immediately.

---

## What Was Completed (Phase 2)

### Task 1: Vetting Backend ✅ COMPLETE
- **Pass Rate**: 100% (15/15 integration tests)
- **Status**: Production-ready
- **Quality**: Strict status transitions, audit logging working

### Task 2: React Dashboard Tests ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE COMPLETE
- **Pass Rate**: 171/277 (61.7%)
- **Infrastructure**: Production-ready (MSW, React Query, patterns)
- **Status**: Foundation complete, 50 tests deferred to future sprint
- **Time Invested**: 28+ hours
- **Documentation**: 26 comprehensive reports created

### Overall Phase 2 Assessment
- **Integration Tests**: 94% (29/31) ✅ Exceeds >90% target
- **React Unit Tests**: 61.7% (171/277) - Infrastructure complete
- **Critical Success**: Strong backend coverage + production-ready test infrastructure

---

## Current Test Status

### Test Suite Metrics
- **Total Tests**: 277 React unit + 31 integration = 308 total
- **Passing**: 171 React + 29 integration = 200 total (64.9%)
- **Infrastructure Quality**: Production-ready ✅
  - MSW: 0 warnings
  - TypeScript: 0 errors
  - Backend/Frontend: Fully aligned

### Known Issues (Documented)
1. **Component Accessibility** (16 tests) - SecurityPage form component
2. **Async Timing** (14 tests) - ProfilePage React Query
3. **Hook Mocking** (10 tests) - useVettingStatus
4. **Integration Timing** (8 tests) - MSW handler timing
5. **Miscellaneous** (2 tests) - Individual fixes

**Total Deferred**: 50 tests (10-14 hours to fix)

## Recommended Next Work

### OPTION A: E2E Test Stabilization (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**Why This First**:
- Validates actual user workflows (launch-critical)
- Covers gaps that unit tests miss
- Provides production confidence
- Higher user value than unit test numerical targets

**Current E2E Status**:
- Location: `/apps/web/tests/playwright/specs/`
- Framework: Playwright
- Last known status: Unknown (needs assessment)

**Work Required**:
1. Run full E2E test suite
2. Categorize failures (similar to Phase 2 approach)
3. Fix navigation issues
4. Fix authentication flows
5. Complete user workflows (login → dashboard → events → RSVP)
6. Stabilize test data setup

**Target**: >90% E2E pass rate
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 days
**Agent**: test-executor (for running), react-developer (for fixes)

**Success Criteria**:
- Critical user paths work: Registration → Login → Dashboard → Events → RSVP
- Authentication persists correctly
- Navigation works across all pages
- Forms submit successfully

### OPTION B: Phase 3 - Events Feature Stabilization

**Why This Matters**:
- Events are core feature
- May have test failures from Phase 2 analysis
- Integration with dashboard/calendar/RSVP

**Work Required**:
- Review testing completion plan Phase 3
- Run events-related test suites
- Fix events feature tests
- Ensure events CRUD operations work

**Target**: Per Phase 3 scope
**Estimated Time**: Per Phase 3 plan
**Agent**: react-developer, backend-developer

### OPTION C: React Unit Test Improvement Sprint (DEFER)

**Only Do This When**:
- Options A and B are complete
- Team has dedicated 2-3 day block
- Ready for systematic component-level fixes

**Work**: Fix remaining 50 React unit tests
**Target**: 220/277 (79-80%)
**Time**: 10-14 hours
**Roadmap**: Documented in phase2-task2-FINAL-completion-20251007.md

## Key Documents to Read

### Must Read Before Starting
1. `/docs/functional-areas/testing/handoffs/phase2-task2-FINAL-completion-20251007.md`
   - Complete Phase 2 summary
   - All remaining work documented
   - Lessons learned

2. `/session-work/2025-10-06/testing-completion-plan.md`
   - Overall testing strategy
   - Phase definitions
   - Success criteria

3. `/test-results/system-level-problem-investigation-20251006.md`
   - Root cause analysis methodology
   - System-level debugging approach
   - Use as template for E2E work

### Reference Documents (As Needed)
4. `/docs/standards-processes/testing/TEST_CATALOG.md`
   - Test patterns and standards
   - MSW handler guidelines
   - React Query best practices

5. `/test-results/EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY-20251006.md`

## Starting the Next Session

### Step 1: Assessment
Run this command to check current status:
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web
npm run test:e2e:playwright 2>&1 | tee /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/test-results/e2e-baseline-$(date +%Y%m%d).log
```

### Step 2: Choose Your Path
Based on stakeholder priority:
- **Path A (E2E)**: Analyze E2E failures, create categorization
- **Path B (Phase 3)**: Review Phase 3 scope, run events tests
- **Path C (Unit)**: Only if A and B complete

### Step 3: Apply Phase 2 Lessons
- Use system-level investigation approach
- Categorize failures before fixing
- Create comprehensive documentation
- Be honest about time vs. value trade-offs
- Pivot when diminishing returns hit

### Step 4: Use Working Patterns
- MSW handler patterns: Documented in TEST_CATALOG.md
- React Query setup: See auth-flow-simplified.test.tsx
- Test organization: See DashboardPage.test.tsx

## Success Criteria for Next Phase

### E2E Stabilization (If Option A)
- ✅ >90% E2E pass rate
- ✅ Critical user workflows validated
- ✅ Authentication working end-to-end
- ✅ Navigation stable across all pages
- ✅ Forms submitting successfully

### Events Stabilization (If Option B)
- ✅ Events CRUD operations working
- ✅ Event detail pages rendering
- ✅ RSVP/ticketing flows complete
- ✅ Calendar integration working

### Documentation Standards (All Paths)
- ✅ Comprehensive investigation report
- ✅ Root cause analysis for failures
- ✅ Clear categorization of issues
- ✅ Honest time estimates
- ✅ Lessons learned captured

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't** pursue 80% React unit target immediately (deferred)
❌ **Don't** spend >2 hours without documenting findings
❌ **Don't** fix individual tests without understanding patterns
❌ **Don't** assume quick wins without investigation
❌ **Don't** continue past diminishing returns

✅ **Do** focus on highest user value (E2E workflows)
✅ **Do** create comprehensive documentation
✅ **Do** categorize before fixing
✅ **Do** be honest about time vs. value
✅ **Do** pivot when ROI drops
