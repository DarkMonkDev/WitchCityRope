# Phase 2 Task 2: Skip Unimplemented Feature Tests - Report

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Agent**: react-developer
**Task**: Identify and skip tests for unimplemented features
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

Successfully identified and marked **2 tests** as skipped that were testing genuinely unimplemented features. This accurately reflects the current state of the codebase and prevents misleading test failures.

**Impact**:
- Tests skipped: **+2** (from 22 to 24 total skipped)
- Pass rate: **57% (147/258 tests)** - slight decrease due to proper test categorization
- These tests will be re-enabled when features are implemented

## Tests Skipped

### 1. DashboardPage: Quick Actions Section
**File**: `/apps/web/src/pages/dashboard/__tests__/DashboardPage.test.tsx`
**Line**: 289-312
**Test**: `should render quick action links correctly`

**Reason**:
- DashboardPage does NOT contain a "Quick Actions" section
- Current implementation (lines 144-157) only contains:
  - UserDashboard component (profile + vetting status)
  - UserParticipations component (events list)
  - MembershipStatistics component (stats cards)
- No Quick Actions UI exists in any child component

**Comment Added**:
```typescript
it.skip('should render quick action links correctly', async () => {
  // SKIPPED: Quick Actions section is not implemented in DashboardPage
  // TODO: Implement Quick Actions component before re-enabling
  // Current implementation: DashboardPage only contains UserDashboard, UserParticipations, and MembershipStatistics
  // See: /apps/web/src/pages/dashboard/DashboardPage.tsx lines 144-157
```

**Re-enable When**: Quick Actions component is designed and implemented

---

### 2. VettingApplicationsList: Enhanced Empty State with Clear Filters
**File**: `/apps/web/src/features/admin/vetting/components/__tests__/VettingApplicationsList.test.tsx`
**Line**: 341-388
**Test**: `shows empty state with clear filters option when filters are applied`

**Reason**:
- VettingApplicationsList does NOT implement filter-aware empty state messaging
- Current implementation shows generic "No vetting applications found" message
- No "Clear Filters" button exists in the component
- No "No applications match your filters" message exists

**Comment Added**:
```typescript
it.skip('shows empty state with clear filters option when filters are applied', async () => {
  // SKIPPED: "Clear Filters" button and "No applications match your filters" message not implemented
  // TODO: Implement enhanced empty state with filter-aware messaging and clear filters functionality
  // Current implementation: VettingApplicationsList shows generic "No vetting applications found" message
  // See: /apps/web/src/features/admin/vetting/components/VettingApplicationsList.tsx
  // Expected behavior: Different empty state messages based on whether filters are active
```

**Re-enable When**: Enhanced empty state UI with filter awareness is implemented

---

## Verification Process

### 1. Component Analysis
I read the actual component implementations to verify features don't exist:

**DashboardPage.tsx** (lines 124-175):
- ✅ Contains UserDashboard
- ✅ Contains UserParticipations
- ✅ Contains MembershipStatistics
- ❌ Does NOT contain Quick Actions section

**VettingApplicationsList.tsx**:
- ✅ Has search functionality
- ✅ Has status filters
- ✅ Has pagination
- ❌ Does NOT have "Clear Filters" button
- ❌ Does NOT have filter-aware empty state messages

### 2. Test Skipping Criteria

I applied strict criteria for skipping tests:

**ONLY skipped if**:
- ✅ Feature genuinely doesn't exist in implementation
- ✅ Test expectations are for future functionality
- ✅ Clear TODO path exists for implementation
- ✅ Test isn't just broken - it's testing unbuilt features

**DID NOT skip**:
- ❌ Tests that are broken due to bugs (those need fixing)
- ❌ Tests with incorrect assertions (those need updating)
- ❌ Tests with missing MSW handlers (those need mocking fixes)

---

## Impact Analysis

### Test Count Changes
```
Before:  148/258 passing (57%) - 22 skipped
After:   147/258 passing (57%) - 24 skipped
Change:  -1 passing, +2 skipped
```

**Why did pass count decrease?**
- One previously passing test was incorrectly passing despite testing unimplemented feature
- Proper categorization as skipped more accurately reflects codebase state

### Toward 80% Target
```
Current:  147 passing
Target:   220 passing (80% of 277 total)
Gap:      73 tests

Skipped breakdown:
- 24 total skipped tests
- 2 new skips (this session)
- 22 existing skips
```

**Analysis**: Skipping unimplemented features alone won't reach 80% target. Main issues:
1. **MSW handler mismatches** - tests expect endpoints that don't exist
2. **Component architecture misalignment** - tests expect features in wrong components
3. **API response format mismatches** - mock data doesn't match actual responses

---

## Tests NOT Skipped (Require Fixing, Not Skipping)

### DashboardPage Tests
These tests FAIL but should NOT be skipped - they need MSW handler fixes:

1. **Event display tests** - Need `/api/user/participations` handler
2. **Event card interaction tests** - Testing UserParticipations component, not DashboardPage
3. **Event sorting tests** - Need proper mock data format

**Fix Strategy**: Add MSW handler for participations API

### EventsPage Tests
All EventsPage tests are PASSING ✅ - no action needed

### ProfilePage Tests
All ProfilePage tests are PASSING ✅ - no action needed

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Add MSW handlers** for missing API endpoints:
   - `/api/user/participations` (DashboardPage tests need this)
   - `/api/vetting/status` (vetting tests need this)

2. **Fix component test organization**:
   - Move UserParticipations tests out of DashboardPage tests
   - Test child components in their own test files

3. **Update mock data formats**:
   - Align with actual API DTO structures
   - Use NSwag-generated types for accuracy

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Document unimplemented features** in `/docs/functional-areas/dashboard/unimplemented-features.md`
2. **Create feature roadmap** for Quick Actions component
3. **Design enhanced empty states** for admin components

## Files Modified

1. `/apps/web/src/pages/dashboard/__tests__/DashboardPage.test.tsx`
   - Lines 289-312: Skipped Quick Actions test with detailed explanation

2. `/apps/web/src/features/admin/vetting/components/__tests__/VettingApplicationsList.test.tsx`
   - Lines 341-388: Skipped Clear Filters test with detailed explanation

---

## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Always Verify Implementation Before Skipping
**Mistake**: Could have skipped tests without reading actual components
**Correct Approach**: Read component source code to confirm feature doesn't exist
**Result**: High confidence that skips are justified

### 2. Document WHY, Not Just WHAT
**Good**: "Skipped because feature not implemented"
**Better**: "Skipped because Quick Actions component doesn't exist. See DashboardPage.tsx lines 144-157 for current structure."

### 3. Distinguish Between Broken and Unimplemented
**Broken**: Test fails due to missing MSW handler → FIX THE TEST
**Unimplemented**: Test fails because feature doesn't exist → SKIP WITH TODO

### 4. Low-Hanging Fruit vs Real Problems
**This task**: Only found 2 genuinely unimplemented features to skip
**Real problem**: ~73 tests failing due to MSW/architecture issues
**Conclusion**: "Skip unimplemented features" is NOT the path to 80%

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Identified tests expecting unimplemented features**: 2 tests found
✅ **Marked with `test.skip()` and clear explanations**: Both tests properly documented
✅ **Verified features don't exist**: Read component source code
✅ **Added TODO comments**: Clear re-enable path documented
✅ **Test suite runs successfully**: All skipped tests properly categorized

---

## Next Session Priorities

**High Impact** (toward 80% target):
1. Add MSW handler for `/api/user/participations` → Could fix ~10-15 tests
2. Reorganize DashboardPage tests → Could fix ~10-15 tests
3. Fix API response format mismatches → Could fix ~5-10 tests

**Low Impact** (accurate but doesn't improve pass rate):
- Continue identifying unimplemented features to skip

**Realistic Assessment**:
- Current: 57% (147/258)
- Achievable with focused effort: 70-75%
- 80% target: May require implementing some missing features, not just fixing tests
