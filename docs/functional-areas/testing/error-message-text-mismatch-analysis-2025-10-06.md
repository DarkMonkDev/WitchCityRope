# Error Message Text Mismatch Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-06
**Task**: Fix error message text mismatches to achieve quick wins toward 70% target
**Status**: COMPLETED - Task assumption was incorrect

## Executive Summary

**Finding**: There are NO error message text mismatches causing test failures.

- **Error message tests examined**: 7 test cases
- **Actual text mismatches found**: 1 (now fixed)
- **Tests still failing**: 4 (due to MSW mock configuration, NOT text mismatches)
- **Pass rate impact**: 0 tests gained (failures are mock issues, not text issues)

## Detailed Analysis

### Tests Examined

1. **DashboardPage - "should handle dashboard loading error"**
   - Test expects: "Unable to Load Dashboard"
   - Component shows: "Unable to Load Dashboard"
   - **Status**: ✅ Text MATCHES
   - **Failure cause**: MSW mock not triggering error state

2. **DashboardPage - "should handle events loading error"**
   - Test expects (original): "Failed to load events. Please try refreshing the page."
   - Component shows: "Unable to Load Participations" (UserParticipations component)
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Updated test to expect correct text and correct API endpoint
   - **Failure cause**: MSW mock still not triggering error state

3. **EventsPage - "should handle events loading error"**
   - Test expects: "Failed to load your events. Please try refreshing the page."
   - Component shows: "Failed to load your events. Please try refreshing the page."
   - **Status**: ✅ Text MATCHES
   - **Failure cause**: MSW mock not triggering error state

4. **ProfilePage - "should handle user loading error"**
   - Test expects: "Failed to load your profile. Please try refreshing the page."
   - Component shows: "Failed to load your profile. Please try refreshing the page."
   - **Status**: ✅ Text MATCHES
   - **Failure cause**: MSW mock not triggering error state

5. **MembershipPage - "should handle user loading error"**
   - Test expects: "Failed to load your membership information. Please try refreshing the page."
   - Component shows: "Failed to load your membership information. Please try refreshing the page."
   - **Status**: ✅ Text MATCHES
   - **Failure cause**: MSW mock not triggering error state

6. **EventsList - error handling tests**
   - Test expects: `/Failed to load events/` (regex)
   - Component shows: "Failed to load events. Please check that the API service is running..."
   - **Status**: ✅ Text MATCHES

7. **VettingApplicationsList - error handling test**
   - Test expects: "Error loading applications: Failed to load applications"
   - Component shows: "Error loading applications: {error.message}"
   - **Status**: ✅ Text MATCHES

## Root Cause: MSW Mock Configuration Issues

All failing error message tests are NOT failing due to text mismatches. They are failing because:

1. **MSW handlers succeed when they should fail**: Tests override handlers to return 500 errors, but other API calls succeed, so components never enter error state.

2. **React Query retry/fallback behavior**: Components may be recovering from errors or using cached data.

3. **Multiple API dependencies**: Dashboard components make multiple API calls - if one fails but others succeed, the error state may not show.

## Files Modified

1. **`/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/apps/web/src/pages/dashboard/__tests__/DashboardPage.test.tsx`**
   - **Line 156-169**: Updated "should handle events loading error" test
   - Changed expected text from "Failed to load events" to "Unable to Load Participations"
   - Changed MSW mock from `/api/events` to `/api/user/participations` (correct endpoint)
   - Added clarifying comment

## Pass Rate Impact

- **Before**: 156/277 tests passing (56.3%)
- **After**: 156/277 tests passing (56.3%)
- **Change**: +0 tests

The fixed test still fails due to MSW mock configuration, NOT text mismatch.

## Recommendations

### For This Task (Error Message Text Mismatches)
**COMPLETE** - No more error message text mismatches exist.

### For Broader Test Improvements

These failures require different expertise:

1. **MSW Mock Configuration** (~5 tests)
   - Agent: test-developer
   - Issue: Error handlers not properly overriding default success handlers
   - Fix: Investigate MSW handler priority and React Query error handling

2. **Component Rendering Issues** (~54 tests)
   - Agent: react-developer
   - Issue: Components not rendering expected elements
   - Fix: Component implementation vs test expectation alignment

3. **Integration Test Setup** (~6 tests)
   - Agent: test-developer
   - Issue: MSW vs global.fetch conflicts
   - Fix: Test isolation and mock configuration

## Conclusion

**The task assumption was incorrect.** There were NO error message text mismatches causing test failures (~10 tests claimed). Only 1 text mismatch existed, which has been fixed. The remaining test failures are due to MSW mock configuration issues, which is a different category of problem requiring test-developer expertise, not react-developer text alignment.

**Recommendation**: Move to next task in Phase 2 Task 2 strategy (mock data mismatches or component boundary issues).
