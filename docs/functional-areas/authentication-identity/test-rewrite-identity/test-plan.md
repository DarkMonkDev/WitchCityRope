## Testing Approach

### Component Testing Strategy
1. **Isolation**: Test components in isolation with mocked dependencies
2. **User Interaction**: Test user interactions (clicks, form inputs)
3. **State Changes**: Verify component state changes
4. **Rendering**: Ensure correct rendering based on props/state
5. **Error Handling**: Test error states and edge cases

### Service Testing Strategy
1. **Mock HTTP**: Use MockHttp for API calls
2. **State Management**: Test service state management
3. **Error Handling**: Test network errors and failures
4. **Caching**: Test caching behavior where applicable
5. **Concurrency**: Test concurrent operations

### Best Practices
1. Use `TestContext` from bUnit for component tests
2. Mock at the service interface level
3. Use builders for test data creation
4. Keep tests focused and independent
5. Use descriptive test names
6. Test both happy path and error cases
7. Avoid testing implementation details
8. Focus on user-facing behavior

## Priority Order
1. **High Priority**
   - Authentication components
   - Core navigation/layout
   - Member dashboard
   - Event listing/details

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Admin components
   - Profile management
   - Payment flows
   - Notification system

3. **Low Priority**
   - Static pages
   - Footer components
   - Breadcrumbs
   - Print styles
