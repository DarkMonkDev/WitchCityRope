# Business Requirements: NuGet Package Updates for API Service
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-11 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary
The WitchCityRope API service requires comprehensive NuGet package updates to resolve version conflicts, eliminate compilation warnings, address security vulnerabilities, and improve system stability. Current package mismatches are causing potential integration issues and creating technical debt that threatens platform reliability.

## Business Context
### Problem Statement
The API service is experiencing NuGet package version conflicts that manifest as compilation warnings where packages default to alternate versions due to dependency mismatches. This creates several critical business risks:
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Outdated packages may contain known security issues that expose user data
- **System Instability**: Version conflicts can cause runtime failures during high-traffic periods
- **Development Inefficiency**: Compilation warnings slow development velocity and mask real issues
- **Technical Debt**: Accumulating version conflicts increase maintenance burden and deployment risks

### Business Value
- **Enhanced Security**: Updated packages provide latest security patches protecting 200+ community members
- **Improved Reliability**: Resolved version conflicts prevent runtime failures during events (workshops/performances)
- **Increased Development Velocity**: Clean compilation enables faster feature development
- **Reduced Support Burden**: Fewer package-related issues means less troubleshooting and maintenance
- **Future-Proofing**: Current packages ensure compatibility with upcoming .NET ecosystem updates

### Success Metrics
- **Zero Compilation Warnings**: All package version conflicts resolved
- **95%+ Package Currency**: All packages within 6 months of latest stable release
- **Security Score Improvement**: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities in dependency scan
- **Build Time Improvement**: 15% faster build times from optimized package graph
- **Runtime Stability**: 99.9% uptime during high-traffic events (workshops with 50+ attendees)

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Experience Improvement
**As a** Backend Developer
**I want to** compile the API without version conflict warnings
**So that** I can identify real compilation issues and develop features efficiently

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the API project is built in development environment
- When I run `dotnet build` or `dotnet run`
- Then there are zero package version conflict warnings
- And build time is optimized by resolving dependency graph efficiently
- And all packages load their intended versions

### Story 2: System Administrator Security Management
**As a** System Administrator
**I want to** ensure all NuGet packages are current with security patches
**So that** the platform remains secure against known vulnerabilities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the API service is running in production
- When security vulnerability scans are performed
- Then there are zero high or critical severity vulnerabilities in dependencies
- And all packages are within 6 months of their latest stable release
- And security audit logs show clean dependency status

### Story 3: Platform Reliability for Community Events
**As a** WitchCityRope Community Member
**I want to** access the platform reliably during workshops and performances
**So that** I can register for events, access materials, and participate fully

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the platform is serving 50+ concurrent users during a workshop
- When members access event registration, user profiles, and content
- Then all API endpoints respond within 200ms (current performance standard)
- And there are no runtime failures related to package version conflicts
- And system maintains 99.9% uptime during events

### Story 4: Deployment Pipeline Stability
**As a** DevOps Engineer
**I want to** deploy the API service without package-related failures
**So that** releases are predictable and rollback procedures work reliably

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a new API deployment to staging environment
- When the deployment process runs automated tests
- Then all package dependencies resolve successfully
- And container builds complete without warnings
- And health checks pass immediately after deployment

### Story 5: Future Framework Compatibility
**As a** Platform Owner
**I want to** maintain compatibility with .NET ecosystem updates
**So that** the platform can leverage new features and remain supported long-term

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given Microsoft releases .NET 10 (future)
- When evaluating upgrade compatibility
- Then current package versions support migration path
- And no legacy dependencies block framework updates
- And upgrade path documentation exists for major version transitions

## Business Rules

### Package Update Standards
1. **Semantic Versioning Compliance**: All updates must respect semantic versioning to prevent breaking changes
2. **Security Priority**: Security updates take precedence over feature updates
3. **Compatibility Matrix**: Packages must maintain compatibility with .NET 9.0 target framework
4. **Testing Requirements**: Each package update requires regression testing of affected API endpoints

### Version Selection Criteria
1. **Stable Releases Only**: No preview or pre-release packages in production
2. **LTS Preference**: Long-term support versions preferred for critical packages (Entity Framework, ASP.NET Core)
3. **Peer Dependency Alignment**: Package versions must be compatible with each other
4. **Microsoft Package Consistency**: All Microsoft packages should align to same major version where possible

### Security Requirements
1. **Vulnerability Scanning**: All packages must pass security vulnerability assessment
2. **Known Issues Review**: Check for known issues in package release notes before updating
3. **Third-party Package Vetting**: Non-Microsoft packages require additional security review
4. **Rollback Capability**: Maintain ability to rollback any package update within 24 hours

### Testing and Validation Standards
1. **Automated Test Pass Rate**: 100% of existing automated tests must pass after updates
2. **Integration Testing**: All API endpoints must be tested with updated packages
3. **Performance Validation**: Response times must not degrade more than 10% after updates
4. **Authentication Verification**: Identity and JWT authentication must function unchanged

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Framework Lock**: Must remain on .NET 9.0 (established in current architecture)
- **Database Compatibility**: Package updates cannot break PostgreSQL Entity Framework integration
- **Authentication Integration**: Must maintain compatibility with ASP.NET Core Identity + JWT pattern
- **Existing API Contracts**: Package updates cannot modify API response structures

### Business Constraints
- **Zero Downtime Requirement**: Updates must be deployable without service interruption
- **Event Schedule Alignment**: Major updates scheduled around community event calendar
- **Rollback Window**: Must be able to rollback within 2 hours if issues detected
- **Documentation Requirement**: All significant package changes must be documented

### Assumptions
- **Development Team Capacity**: 8-16 hours available for package update implementation and testing
- **Testing Environment Availability**: Staging environment mirrors production for validation
- **Database Compatibility**: Current Entity Framework migrations will work with updated packages
- **Third-party Service Integration**: External services (PayPal, Venmo) will remain compatible

## Security & Privacy Requirements

### Security Vulnerability Management
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: All packages scanned for CVE database matches
- **Risk Classification**: High/Critical vulnerabilities addressed within 48 hours
- **Dependency Chain Analysis**: Transitive dependencies included in security evaluation

### Authentication Security
- **Token Security**: JWT package updates must maintain current security standards
- **Password Hashing**: BCrypt.Net updates must preserve existing password compatibility
- **Session Management**: ASP.NET Core Identity updates must maintain session security
- **CORS Configuration**: Updated packages must maintain secure CORS policies

## Compliance Requirements

### Platform Policies
- **Community Standards**: Updates must not affect user safety and consent features
- **Accessibility Requirements**: Updated UI packages must maintain WCAG compliance (Mantine v7)
- **Data Retention**: Package updates must preserve existing data retention capabilities
- **Member Privacy**: Vetted vs. public information access controls must remain intact

### Technical Standards
