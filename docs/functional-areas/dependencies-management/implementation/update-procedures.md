## NuGet Package Update Process

### Pre-Update Assessment
1. **Security Scan**: Run vulnerability assessment
2. **Compatibility Check**: Review breaking changes in release notes
3. **Impact Analysis**: Identify affected components
4. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure rollback capability

### Update Execution
1. **Development Environment**
   - Update packages in development branch
   - Run full test suite
   - Verify application functionality

2. **Staging Environment**
   - Deploy to staging
   - Execute integration tests
   - Perform manual testing

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Deploy during maintenance window
   - Monitor application health
   - Validate critical functionality

### Post-Update Validation
1. **Automated Testing**: All test suites pass
2. **Performance Monitoring**: No degradation detected
3. **Error Monitoring**: No new error patterns
4. **User Acceptance**: Key stakeholder validation

## NPM Package Update Process

### Frontend Package Updates
[To be documented based on React migration patterns]

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback Triggers
- Application fails to start
- Critical functionality broken
- Security vulnerabilities introduced
- Performance degradation > 20%

### Rollback Execution
1. **Code Rollback**: Revert to previous commit
2. **Dependency Rollback**: Restore previous package versions
3. **Database Considerations**: Check for migration reversals needed
4. **Verification**: Confirm rollback successful

## Documentation Requirements

### Update Documentation
- **Change Log**: What packages were updated
- **Impact Assessment**: What changed in the application
- **Testing Results**: Evidence of successful validation
- **Known Issues**: Any limitations or workarounds

### Process Improvements
- **Lessons Learned**: What could be improved
- **Automation Opportunities**: Steps that could be automated
- **Risk Mitigation**: Better ways to reduce update risks
