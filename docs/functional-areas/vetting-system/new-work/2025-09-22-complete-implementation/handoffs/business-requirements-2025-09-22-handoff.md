# Business Requirements Handoff - Vetting System Implementation
<!-- Date: 2025-09-22 -->
<!-- From: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- To: UI Designer & React Developer -->
<!-- Status: Requirements Phase Complete - Updated Based on User Feedback -->

## Phase: Business Requirements Complete (Updated)
## Date: 2025-09-22
## Feature: WitchCityRope Vetting System Implementation
## Version: 2.0 (Updated based on comprehensive user feedback)

## üéØ CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES (MUST IMPLEMENT)

1. **Authentication Required Before Application**: Users MUST create account and login before accessing vetting form
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Check authentication state, redirect to login if not authenticated
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Allow anonymous users to start application process

2. **Single Application Per Member**: Only ONE application allowed per member - no resubmission
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Check if user already has application, prevent new submissions, show status instead
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Allowing multiple applications from same user

3. **Single Session Submission Only**: NO draft functionality - application completed in one session
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Form clears on browser refresh, no save/resume functionality
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Implementing auto-save or draft storage system

4. **Dashboard Status Integration**: Application status shown on user dashboard, NOT separate page
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Status prominently displayed on user dashboard with clear next steps
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Creating separate application status page

5. **Optional Admin Notes**: Admin notes are OPTIONAL - automatic notes sufficient for audit trail
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Admin can add notes but not required, system generates automatic notes
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Making admin notes mandatory for status changes

6. **Email Templates in Vetting Admin**: Templates managed within vetting section, NOT generic email management
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Email template management co-located with vetting admin interface
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Generic email template system separate from vetting workflow

7. **Bulk Operations**: Admins can perform bulk reminder emails and bulk status changes
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Checkbox selection with bulk actions for efficiency
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Only individual application management

| Document | Path | Critical Sections |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| **Business Requirements v2.0** | `/docs/functional-areas/vetting-system/new-work/2025-09-22-complete-implementation/requirements/business-requirements.md` | Updated User Stories (lines 74-192), New Email Templates (lines 356-396), Bulk Operations (lines 174-192) |
| **Test Executor Handoff** | `/docs/functional-areas/vetting-system/handoffs/test-executor-2025-09-13-handoff.md` | Critical database migration issues, existing API status |
| **DTO Alignment Strategy** | `/docs/architecture/react-migration/DTO-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md` | NSwag auto-generation requirements, NEVER create manual DTOs |
| **Domain Architecture** | `/docs/architecture/react-migration/domain-layer-architecture.md` | Type generation pipeline, build dependencies |

## üö® UPDATED BUSINESS RULES & FEATURES

### Major Changes from User Feedback:

1. **Application Stages Updated**:
   - OLD: Submitted ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí Interview Scheduled ‚Üí Final Decision
   - NEW: Submitted ‚Üí Under Review ‚Üí **Interview Approved** ‚Üí Interview Scheduled ‚Üí Final Decision
   - **Interview Approved**: User can schedule but hasn't yet (NEW stage)

2. **Email Templates Updated** (now 6 types):
   1. Application Received
   2. **Interview Approved** (NEW - ready to schedule)
   3. Application Approved
   4. Application On Hold
   5. Application Denied
   6. **Interview Reminder** (NEW - for old interview-approved applications)

3. **Application Form Simplified**:
   - **REMOVED**: Emergency contact field
   - **REMOVED**: References section
   - **REMOVED**: File upload capability
   - **KEEP**: Use existing wireframe as guide

4. **Features Explicitly Removed**:
   - ‚ùå Appeal process for denials (decisions are final)
   - ‚ùå Anonymous feedback system
   - ‚ùå Membership cards
   - ‚ùå References system
   - ‚ùå Emergency contacts
   - ‚ùå Separate application status page

5. **New Bulk Operations**:
   - **Send Reminder Emails**: For interview-approved applications older than X days
   - **Bulk Status Change to On Hold**: For applications older than X days that haven't responded

6. **On Hold Process**:
   - On Hold emails direct users to contact support@witchcityrope.com to reactivate
   - No automated reactivation process

## üö® KNOWN PITFALLS

1. **Database Schema Sync Issue**: EF Core migrations are out of sync from September 13 testing
   - **Why it happens**: Database schema doesn't match current model
   - **How to avoid**: Run migration sync BEFORE implementing any database operations

2. **Manual DTO Interface Creation**: Creating TypeScript interfaces manually instead of using NSwag
   - **Why it happens**: Developer unfamiliarity with type generation pipeline
   - **How to avoid**: ALWAYS use generated types from @witchcityrope/shared-types package

3. **Implementing Draft Functionality**: Natural developer instinct to add save/resume
   - **Why it happens**: Common UX pattern, seems helpful
   - **How to avoid**: Explicitly documented as NOT REQUIRED in business rules

4. **Creating Separate Status Page**: Developer might create dedicated application status page
   - **Why it happens**: Seems like natural separation of concerns
   - **How to avoid**: Status MUST be integrated into user dashboard per requirements

5. **Making Admin Notes Required**: Making notes mandatory for status changes
   - **Why it happens**: Seems like good audit practice
   - **How to avoid**: Notes are OPTIONAL - automatic notes are sufficient

6. **Generic Email Management**: Putting templates in general admin email section
   - **Why it happens**: Cleaner separation of concerns
   - **How to avoid**: Templates MUST be in vetting admin section for workflow efficiency

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before proceeding to implementation phase, verify:

- [ ] Authentication check implemented before application access
- [ ] One application per member enforcement
- [ ] No draft/save functionality in application form
- [ ] Application status integrated into user dashboard
- [ ] Admin notes are optional, automatic notes generated
- [ ] Email templates managed within vetting admin section

## üîÑ DISCOVERED CONSTRAINTS

1. **Existing API Implementation**: Vetting system backend largely complete from September 13
   - **Impact**: Frontend needs to integrate with existing endpoints
   - **Required Changes**: Review existing API structure before new development

2. **Database Migration Blocker**: Schema sync issues prevent integration testing
   - **Impact**: Cannot validate database operations until migrations fixed
   - **Required Changes**: Backend developer must resolve migration sync first

3. **SendGrid Configuration**: Email service not yet configured
   - **Impact**: Email functionality cannot be tested until service setup
   - **Required Changes**: DevOps setup of SendGrid API keys and configuration

4. **Authentication System**: Uses existing platform authentication
   - **Impact**: Must integrate with current login system
   - **Required Changes**: Use existing auth context and role checking patterns

5. **Calendar Integration**: Future consideration for Google Calendar
   - **Impact**: Interview scheduling may need future enhancement
   - **Required Changes**: Note in technical debt for future development

**Key Finding**: Requirements significantly simplified and focused. Dashboard integration and bulk operations are new key features. Email template management co-located with vetting admin for workflow efficiency.

**Next Agent Should Be**: UI Designer (for updated mockups) then React Developer (for implementation)
**Next Phase**: Design & Implementation
**Estimated Effort** (Updated):
- UI Design: 3-4 days (additional bulk operations and dashboard integration)
