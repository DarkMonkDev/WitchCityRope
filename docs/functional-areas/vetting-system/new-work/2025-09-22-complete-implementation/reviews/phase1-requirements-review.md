## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY HUMAN REVIEW CHECKPOINT

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Please review and approve these business requirements before we proceed to Phase 2 (Design & Architecture).

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 of the vetting system implementation is complete. We have analyzed the existing September 13 implementation, identified gaps, and created comprehensive business requirements for completing the system. The requirements focus on three major components: user application flow, admin review interface, and email template management.

## Requirements Overview

### 1. User Application Process âœ…
- **Authentication Required**: Users must create account before applying
- **Single Session Submission**: No draft functionality per user request
- **Email Confirmation**: SendGrid integration for immediate confirmation
- **Status Tracking**: User can check application progress

### 2. Admin Review System âœ…
- **Grid-Based Interface**: Similar to existing events admin screen
- **Detailed Application View**: All fields, notes, and audit history
- **Workflow Actions**: Move applications through stages
- **Notes System**: Both manual and automatic notes with history

### 3. Email Template Management âœ…
- **5 Template Types**: Received, Interview, Approved, Hold, Denied
- **Admin-Editable**: In-platform template editing capability
- **Variable Substitution**: Dynamic content based on application data
- **Automated Triggers**: Status changes trigger appropriate emails

## Gap Analysis Results

### What Exists âœ…
- Complete API entity models (11+ entities)
- API endpoints structure
- Basic React components
- Wireframes for application form and confirmation

### What Needs Implementation ðŸ”§
1. **Frontend Components**:
   - Complete application form
   - Admin review grid interface
   - Email template editor
   - User status page

2. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Email service integration
   - Template storage and management
   - Admin notes system
   - Audit logging enhancements

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Database migration sync (CRITICAL)
   - SendGrid configuration
   - Type generation updates

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Database Migration**: Must be resolved before implementation
2. **SendGrid Setup**: Required for email functionality
3. **Authentication Integration**: Leverage existing platform auth
4. **Consistent UI**: Match existing admin interface patterns

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Database schema conflicts | High | High | Resolve migrations first |
| SendGrid configuration issues | Medium | Medium | Early testing required |
| Complex admin UI requirements | Medium | Low | Use existing patterns |
| Email template complexity | Low | Medium | Simple variable system |

## User Stories Summary

**12 User Stories Defined** covering:
- User application submission (3 stories)
- Admin review process (4 stories)
- Email template management (3 stories)
- Audit and compliance (2 stories)
