## üö® MANDATORY HUMAN REVIEW CHECKPOINT

**ACTION REQUIRED**: Please review and approve these UI mockups before we proceed with functional specification, database design, and technical architecture.

## Executive Summary

UI Design for the vetting system is complete with 6 comprehensive mockups covering all user and admin interfaces. The design maintains consistency with existing admin patterns while implementing the signature Design System v7 elements including floating labels, signature animations, and the burgundy/rose-gold color scheme.
