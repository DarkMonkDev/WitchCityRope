# Implementation to QA Handoff: Conditional "How to Join" Menu Visibility
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-10-04 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: React Development Team -->
<!-- Status: Ready for QA -->

## Handoff Summary

**Feature**: Conditional "How to Join" Menu Visibility Based on Vetting Status
**Implementation Date**: October 4, 2025
**Handoff Date**: October 4, 2025
**Development Team**: React Developer Agent
**QA Team**: Test Executor Agent
**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR QA TESTING**

## What Was Built

### Feature Overview
Implemented intelligent navigation menu logic that shows or hides the "How to Join" menu item based on the user's vetting application status. Users with pending applications see their current status with helpful next steps, while vetted members and certain other user states no longer see the irrelevant menu item.

### Core Functionality
1. **Conditional Menu Visibility**: "How to Join" menu item appears/disappears based on vetting status
2. **Status Display**: Users with pending applications see a status information box
3. **Type-Safe Implementation**: Full TypeScript coverage with generated API types
4. **Real-Time Updates**: Uses TanStack Query for fresh vetting status data
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: 46 unit and integration tests with 100% pass rate

### Technical Components Implemented
- ✅ TypeScript type definitions for vetting status (10 statuses)
- ✅ `useVettingStatus` hook for API data fetching
- ✅ `useMenuVisibility` hook for business logic
- ✅ `VettingStatusBox` component with 10 status variants
- ✅ Navigation component integration
- ✅ VettingApplicationPage updates
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (46 tests)

## Test User Accounts Reference

### Pre-Configured Test Accounts
All passwords: `Test123!`

| Email | Role | Vetting Status | IsVetted | Test Purpose |
|-------|------|----------------|----------|--------------|
| admin@witchcityrope.com | Admin | Approved | true | Vetted member - menu hidden |
| teacher@witchcityrope.com | Teacher | Approved | true | Vetted member - menu hidden |
| vetted@witchcityrope.com | Member | Approved | true | Vetted member - menu hidden |
| member@witchcityrope.com | Member | None | false | No application - menu visible |
| guest@witchcityrope.com | Guest | None | false | No application - menu visible |

### Creating Additional Test Users
To test specific vetting statuses not covered by seed data:

**Option 1: Via Admin Panel**
1. Log in as admin@witchcityrope.com
2. Navigate to Admin > Vetting
3. Find or create application
4. Change status using admin controls

**Option 2: Via API**
```bash
# Update vetting status via API
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5655/api/vetting/{applicationId}/status \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": 2}' # UnderReview
```

**Option 3: Via Database**
```sql
-- Update vetting status directly (development only!)
UPDATE "VettingApplications"
SET "Status" = 2 -- UnderReview
WHERE "UserId" = 'user-guid-here';
```

## Known Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: User Has Multiple Applications
**Current Behavior**: API returns most recent application
**Expected**: Only most recent application status affects menu visibility
**Test**: Create multiple applications for same user, verify latest status used

### Edge Case 2: Status Changes While Page Open
**Current Behavior**: TanStack Query refetches on window focus
**Expected**: Menu updates when user returns to tab after admin changes status
**Test**: Change status in admin panel, switch back to user tab, verify update

### Edge Case 3: Race Condition on Login
**Current Behavior**: Menu appears before vetting status loads
**Expected**: Menu visibility updates after status fetch completes
**Test**: Slow network + vetted user login, ensure menu disappears after load

### Edge Case 4: Cached Status Data
**Current Behavior**: TanStack Query caches for 5 minutes
**Expected**: Stale data acceptable for 5 minutes, then refetch
**Test**: Verify cache time is reasonable, not too long or too short
