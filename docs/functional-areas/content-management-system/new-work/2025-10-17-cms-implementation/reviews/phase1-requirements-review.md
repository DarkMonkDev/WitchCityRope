<!-- Status: Approved -->

## Review Date
**Date**: October 17, 2025
**Reviewer**: Chad Bennett (Stakeholder/Product Owner)
**Review Type**: Phase 1 - Business Requirements Approval

---

## Approval Status

**APPROVED** ✅

The business requirements for the Content Management System have been reviewed and approved for progression to Phase 2 - Design & Architecture.

---

## Stakeholder Feedback

### 1. Initial Page Scope - CONFIRMED ✅
**Feedback**: Start with **3 pages only**:
- Contact Us
- Resources
- Private Lessons

**Decision**: Approved as specified. No additional pages for MVP.

---

### 2. Admin-Only Access - CONFIRMED ✅
**Feedback**: **Administrator role only** should have editing capabilities.
**Decision**: Approved. No Teacher or other role access for MVP.

---

### 3. Text-Only Content - CONFIRMED ✅
**Feedback**: **No image uploads** for MVP. Text content only with TipTap rich text editor.
**Decision**: Approved. Image upload is a future enhancement with DigitalOcean Spaces integration.

---

### 4. Live Editing (No Draft States) - CONFIRMED ✅
**Feedback**: **Immediate publishing** - all saves go live instantly without draft/published workflow.
**Decision**: Approved. Admins are trusted to publish immediately. Draft states are out of scope for MVP.

---

### 5. Revision History UI - NEW REQUIREMENT ✅
**Feedback**: Build **admin dashboard page** to view revision history, not just database logging.
**Decision**: Approved as Phase 2 requirement after initial implementation.

**New User Story**:
```
User Story: As an administrator, I want to view revision history for CMS pages
in the admin dashboard, so I can see who changed what and when, and potentially
restore previous versions.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Admin dashboard page lists all CMS pages with revision counts
- Clicking a page shows full revision history (date, user, content preview)
- Each revision shows full content snapshot
- UI displays who made the change and when
- Future: Ability to restore/rollback to previous revision
```

---

### 6. Route-Based Page Identification - APPROVED ✅
**Feedback**: Slug-based routing approach is acceptable:
- `/resources` → resources page
- `/contact-us` → contact-us page
- `/private-lessons` → private-lessons page

**Decision**: Approved. Developer adds new routes as needed (infrequent operation).

---

### 7. Optimistic Updates - APPROVED ✅
**Feedback**: Optimistic UI updates for instant perceived save time (<16ms) are appropriate.
**Decision**: Approved. Rollback on failure with error notification is acceptable UX pattern.

---

### 8. Edit Button Visibility - UPDATED ✅
**Feedback**: Edit button should be **always visible** to admins, not hidden until hover.
**Decision**: Approved with clarification.

**Previous Requirement** (Implicit): Edit button might be hover-only
**Updated Requirement**: Edit button is **always visible** to administrators for clear discoverability

---

### 9. Future Scalability - NOTED ✅
**Feedback**: Architecture should support:
- Adding more CMS pages easily (just add route mapping)
- Future image upload capability with DigitalOcean Spaces file storage

**Decision**: Noted for future phases. Not blocking MVP.

---

### 10. No Additional Pages - CONFIRMED ✅
**Feedback**: Start with **3 pages only**. Additional pages will be added as needed in future.
**Decision**: Approved. MVP scope is fixed at 3 pages.

---

## Approval for Phase 2 Progression

**Approved Deliverables**:
- ✅ Business Requirements Document (version 1.0)
- ✅ Technology Research (TipTap editor capabilities, route-based architecture)
- ✅ Security Requirements (XSS prevention, admin-only authorization)
- ✅ Performance Requirements (<200ms load, <500ms save, optimistic updates)
- ✅ User Stories (5 complete stories with acceptance criteria)
- ✅ Data Structure Requirements (DTOs defined, NSwag type generation planned)

**Quality Gate Status**: **100% Complete** ✅

---

## Phase 2 - Design & Architecture Requirements

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE**: UI Design MUST come first, before Functional Specification.

**Next Steps** (in order):
1. **UI Design First** - Wireframes/mockups for editing workflow
2. **Functional Specification** - Detailed technical requirements
3. **Technical Design** - API contracts, database schema, component architecture
4. **Test Plan** - Test strategy and acceptance criteria

**Human Review Required**: After UI Design completion (before implementation).

---

## Key Decisions Documented

### Scope Decisions
- **MVP Pages**: 3 pages (Contact Us, Resources, Private Lessons)
- **Content Type**: Text-only with TipTap rich text formatting
- **Publishing Model**: Live editing without draft states
- **Access Control**: Administrator role only

### Architecture Decisions
- **Page Identification**: Route-based with slug mapping
- **Editor Component**: Existing @mantine/tiptap component
- **Type Safety**: NSwag-generated TypeScript from C# DTOs
- **Performance**: Optimistic updates with <16ms perceived save time

### Security Decisions
- **XSS Prevention**: Backend HTML sanitization with HtmlSanitizer.NET
- **Authorization**: ASP.NET Core Identity role-based (Administrator only)
- **Audit Trail**: Complete revision history with user attribution

### Future Considerations
- **More Pages**: Easy to add (just add route + database entry)
- **Image Upload**: Phase 2 feature with DigitalOcean Spaces integration
- **Draft States**: Can be added if needed with database column + UI toggle
- **Rollback**: Revision restore capability in future phase
