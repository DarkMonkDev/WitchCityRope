# React Developer - Final Mobile FAB Fix Handoff

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Session**: CMS Mobile FAB Final Debugging
**Agent**: react-developer
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - All tests passing

## üéØ Problem Summary

**Mobile FAB button not working** - Playwright test showed button with `position: relative` instead of `position: fixed`, meaning the FAB was not rendering at all on mobile viewports. The desktop button was incorrectly showing on mobile instead.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Previous Approach Failed**: Using Mantine's responsive props (`hiddenFrom`, `visibleFrom`) does not work with Playwright viewport changes. These props rely on CSS media queries that Playwright doesn't properly trigger during `page.setViewportSize()` calls.

**Evidence from Test Output**:
```
‚úÖ Viewport set to mobile (375√ó667)
‚úÖ Edit button visible on mobile
Button position: relative  ‚Üê WRONG! Should be "fixed" for FAB
‚ùå Editor did not open after clicking button
```

This proved the FAB wasn't rendering - the desktop button (with `position: relative`) was still showing on mobile.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### Approach: Prop-Based Conditional Rendering

**Replaced** Mantine responsive props with explicit conditional rendering based on viewport width passed as a prop from parent component.

### Why This Works

1. **Explicit control**: Parent component detects viewport width using `useViewportSize()` hook
2. **Prop-based rendering**: Child component receives actual viewport width and makes rendering decision
3. **Playwright compatible**: Viewport width updates immediately on `setViewportSize()` calls
4. **No CSS media queries**: Avoids Mantine's CSS-based responsive props that don't work with Playwright

## üîß Changes Made

### File 1: CmsEditButton.tsx

**Location**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/apps/web/src/features/cms/components/CmsEditButton.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. Added `viewportWidth?: number` prop to component interface
2. Removed `hiddenFrom="md"` and `visibleFrom="md"` Mantine props
3. Implemented explicit `if (isMobile)` conditional rendering
4. Ensured FAB has `position: fixed` in style object
5. Added clear comments explaining why Mantine responsive props don't work

**Key Code**:
```typescript
interface CmsEditButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void
  viewportWidth?: number  // NEW
}

export const CmsEditButton: React.FC<CmsEditButtonProps> = ({
  onClick,
  viewportWidth = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.innerWidth : 1024
}) => {
  const isMobile = viewportWidth < 768

  // CRITICAL: Use explicit conditional rendering instead of Mantine responsive props
  // Mantine's hiddenFrom/visibleFrom don't work reliably with Playwright viewport changes
  if (isMobile) {
    // Mobile FAB (Floating Action Button)
    return (
      <ActionIcon
        onClick={onClick}
        size={56}
        radius="xl"
        variant="gradient"
        gradient={{ from: 'orange', to: 'red', deg: 45 }}
        style={{
          position: 'fixed', // MUST be fixed for FAB
          bottom: 24,
          right: 24,
          zIndex: 999999,
          boxShadow: '0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)',
        }}
        aria-label="Edit page content"
        data-testid="cms-edit-fab"
      >
        <IconEdit size={24} />
      </ActionIcon>
    )
  }

  // Desktop sticky button
  return (
    <Button
      onClick={onClick}
      leftSection={<IconEdit size={18} />}
      variant="outline"
      color="red"
      style={{
        position: 'sticky',
        top: 16,
        float: 'right',
        marginLeft: 16,
        zIndex: 10,
      }}
      data-testid="cms-edit-button"
    >
      Edit
    </Button>
  )
}
```

### File 2: CmsPage.tsx

**Location**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/apps/web/src/features/cms/components/CmsPage.tsx`

**Changes**:
1. Added `useViewportSize` import from `@mantine/hooks`
2. Used hook to get current viewport width
3. Passed `viewportWidth` prop to `CmsEditButton` component

**Key Code**:
```typescript
import { useViewportSize } from '@mantine/hooks'

export const CmsPage: React.FC<CmsPageProps> = ({ slug, defaultTitle, defaultContent }) => {
  const user = useUser()
  const isAdmin = user?.role === 'Administrator'
  const { width: viewportWidth } = useViewportSize()  // NEW

  // ... rest of component

  return (
    <Container size="lg" py="xl">
      {/* Edit button (admin-only) */}
      {isAdmin && !isEditing && <CmsEditButton onClick={handleEdit} viewportWidth={viewportWidth} />}

      {/* ... rest of JSX */}
    </Container>
  )
}
```

## üß™ Test Results

**All 9 CMS tests passing** - Mobile FAB test now shows correct behavior:

```
‚úÖ Viewport set to mobile (375√ó667)
‚úÖ FAB button visible on mobile
‚úÖ Desktop button hidden on mobile
FAB position: fixed  ‚Üê CORRECT!
‚úÖ Editor opened after FAB click
```

**Full Test Suite**:
- ‚úÖ Happy Path: Admin can edit and save page content (6.2s)
- ‚úÖ Cancel: Shows Mantine Modal for unsaved changes (5.7s)
- ‚úÖ XSS Prevention: Backend sanitizes malicious HTML (6.7s)
- ‚úÖ Revision History: Admin can view page revision history (4.9s)
- ‚úÖ Mobile Responsive: FAB button visible on mobile viewport (7.1s) ‚Üê **FIXED!**
- ‚úÖ Non-Admin: Edit button hidden for non-admin users (3.8s)
- ‚úÖ Public Access: CMS pages accessible without login (2.0s)
- ‚úÖ Multiple Pages: Admin can navigate between CMS pages (4.3s)
- ‚úÖ Performance: Save response time < 1 second (3.5s)

**Total**: 9 passed (10.0s)

## üìã Why Previous Approaches Failed

### Attempt 1: CSS Media Queries
- **Why it failed**: Media queries in stylesheets don't update when Playwright changes viewport
- **What we saw**: FAB never rendered on mobile

### Attempt 2: Mantine Responsive Props (hiddenFrom/visibleFrom)
- **Why it failed**: These props use CSS media queries internally
- **What we saw**: Same as Attempt 1 - desktop button showed on mobile

### Attempt 3: useMediaQuery Hook
- **Why it failed**: Hook doesn't re-evaluate when Playwright changes viewport
- **What we saw**: Hook returned desktop value even after viewport change

### ‚úÖ Final Solution: Prop-Based Rendering
- **Why it works**: Parent component passes actual window.innerWidth as prop
- **What we see**: Component receives updated width and renders correct button immediately

---

## üö® Critical Lessons Learned

### 1. Mantine Responsive Props Don't Work with Playwright

**Never use** for Playwright-tested components:
- `hiddenFrom` prop
- `visibleFrom` prop
- `useMediaQuery` hook (unless explicitly testing media query behavior)

**Instead use**:
- Explicit prop-based conditional rendering
- Pass viewport width from parent
- Use Mantine's `useViewportSize()` hook in parent, pass to child as prop

### 2. CSS-Based Solutions Are Not Playwright-Compatible

**Problem**: CSS media queries don't update when Playwright programmatically changes viewport size

**Solution**: JavaScript-based viewport detection with props

### 3. Test Evidence Is Critical

The test output showing `Button position: relative` instead of `fixed` was the key evidence that proved the FAB wasn't rendering at all - we were seeing the wrong button.

## üéØ Prevention Checklist

When creating responsive components for Playwright testing:

1. ‚úÖ **Use `useViewportSize()` hook in parent component**
2. ‚úÖ **Pass viewport width as prop to child components**
3. ‚úÖ **Use explicit conditional rendering (if/ternary) based on props**
4. ‚úÖ **Avoid Mantine responsive props** (`hiddenFrom`, `visibleFrom`)
5. ‚úÖ **Avoid CSS media queries** for show/hide logic in tested components
6. ‚úÖ **Verify computed styles in tests** (check `position`, `display`, etc.)
7. ‚úÖ **Test on actual viewport changes** to catch CSS-based issues

## üí° Reusable Pattern

**This pattern can be used for any Mantine component needing responsive behavior in Playwright tests:**

```typescript
// Parent Component
import { useViewportSize } from '@mantine/hooks'

export const ParentComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { width } = useViewportSize()

  return <ResponsiveChild viewportWidth={width} />
}

// Child Component
interface ResponsiveChildProps {
  viewportWidth?: number
}

export const ResponsiveChild: React.FC<ResponsiveChildProps> = ({
  viewportWidth = typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.innerWidth : 1024
}) => {
  const isMobile = viewportWidth < 768

  if (isMobile) {
    return <MobileVersion />
  }

  return <DesktopVersion />
}
```
