## From: React Developer Agent
## To: Backend Developer / Functional Spec Agent

---

## 🎯 PHASE 2A DELIVERABLES COMPLETED

### 1. SeverityBadge Component ✅
**File**: `/apps/web/src/features/safety/components/SeverityBadge.tsx`

**Implementation Details**:
- 4 severity variants: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Color-coded according to design specifications:
  - Critical: #AA0130 (red)
  - High: #FF8C00 (orange)
  - Medium: #FFBF00 (amber) with dark text for contrast
  - Low: #4A5C3A (forest green)
- Responsive sizing: xs, sm, md, lg, xl
- ARIA labels for accessibility
- Uppercase labels with proper letter spacing

**Usage Example**:
```tsx
<SeverityBadge severity="Critical" size="md" />
```

---

### 2. IncidentStatusBadge Component ✅
**File**: `/apps/web/src/features/safety/components/IncidentStatusBadge.tsx`

**Implementation Details**:
- 5 status variants matching NEW backend enum:
  - ReportSubmitted: #614B79 (plum)
  - InformationGathering: #7B2CBF (electric purple)
  - ReviewingFinalReport: #E6AC00 (dark amber)
  - OnHold: #FFBF00 (bright amber) with dark text
  - Closed: #4A5C3A (forest green)
- Responsive labels: Short labels on xs/sm sizes, full labels on md+
- ARIA labels for accessibility
- CSS class for targeting: `status-{statusname}`

**Usage Example**:
```tsx
<IncidentStatusBadge status="InformationGathering" size="lg" />
```

---

### 3. Public Incident Report Form ✅
**File**: `/apps/web/src/pages/safety/IncidentReportPage.tsx`

**Implementation Details**:
- Anonymous toggle (default: ON)
- Conditional contact information fields
- Severity selection with visual cards (4 levels)
- Incident details: date, time, location, description
- People involved: involved parties, witnesses
- Form validation using Mantine's useForm hook
- Updated confirmation screens (NO reference number shown)
- Support resources section
- Mobile-responsive layout

**Key Features**:
- ✅ NO reference number displayed to ANY submitter
- ✅ Anonymous confirmation: Simple success message
- ✅ Identified confirmation: Link to "My Reports" page
- ✅ Severity visual cards with color-coded badges
- ✅ Form validation before submission
- ✅ Privacy notices and confidentiality alerts
- ✅ Mantine v7 components throughout

**Confirmation Screen Variations**:

**Anonymous**:
- Success checkmark icon
- "Your report has been submitted and will be reviewed by our safety team."
- Privacy note: "This report was submitted anonymously. We cannot provide status updates."
- Support resources displayed
- Return Home button only

**Identified**:
- Success checkmark icon
- "Your report has been received and you will be contacted if additional information is needed."
- "You can view the status of your reports in the My Reports section."
- Two buttons: "View My Reports" and "Return Home"
- NO reference number shown

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DECISIONS

### 1. NO Reference Number Display
**Stakeholder Decision Implemented**: Reference numbers are internal admin tracking ONLY.

- ❌ Reference number NOT shown to anonymous submitters
- ❌ Reference number NOT shown to identified submitters
- ✅ Anonymous users see basic success message
- ✅ Identified users directed to "My Reports" for status tracking

**Files Updated**:
- IncidentReportPage.tsx: Removed all reference number display logic

---

### 2. Severity System - 4 Visual Levels
**Updated from wireframe**: Replaced "Type of Incident" with "Severity Level" cards.

**Implementation**:
- Visual severity cards with color-coded badges
- Clickable cards with border highlight when selected
- Description text under each severity level
- Clear visual hierarchy

**Severity Descriptions**:
- **Low**: Minor concern, documentation only
- **Medium**: Safety concern requiring follow-up
- **High**: Boundary violation, harassment
- **Critical**: Immediate safety risk, consent violation

---

### 3. Form Validation Strategy
**Pattern Used**: Mantine useForm with inline validation

```typescript
validate: {
  contactEmail: (value, values) =>
    !values.isAnonymous && !value ? 'Email is required for identified reports' : null,
  severity: (value) => !value ? 'Please select a severity level' : null,
  incidentDate: (value) => !value ? 'Incident date is required' : null,
  location: (value) => !value || value.length < 3 ? 'Location is required' : null,
  description: (value) =>
    !value || value.length < 20 ? 'Description must be at least 20 characters' : null
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Real-time validation feedback
- Conditional validation (email required only if identified)
- Submit button disabled if errors exist
- Clear error messages

---

## 📋 BACKEND INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### API Endpoint Needed: POST /api/safety/incidents

**Request Schema** (from generated types):
```typescript
interface CreateIncidentRequest {
  severity: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High' | 'Critical';
  incidentDate: string;  // ISO 8601 format
  location: string;
  description: string;
  involvedParties?: string | null;
  witnesses?: string | null;
  isAnonymous: boolean;
  requestFollowUp?: boolean;
  contactEmail?: string | null;
  contactPhone?: string | null;
}
```

**Response Schema**:
```typescript
interface CreateIncidentResponse {
  success: boolean;
  message?: string;
  // NO referenceNumber returned to client
}
```

**CRITICAL**: Backend must NOT return reference number to client for anonymous OR identified submitters.

---

### Status Enum Verification ✅

**Backend Enum** (from generated types):
```typescript
type IncidentStatus =
  | "ReportSubmitted"
  | "InformationGathering"
  | "ReviewingFinalReport"
  | "OnHold"
  | "Closed";
```

**Status**: ✅ Backend has been updated to 5-stage enum
**NSwag Types**: ✅ Generated types include new enum values
**Components**: ✅ IncidentStatusBadge supports all 5 statuses

- Support resources always displayed

---

## 🚧 KNOWN LIMITATIONS & TODO

### API Integration
**Status**: Placeholder API call in IncidentReportPage.tsx

**TODO**: Replace mock API call with actual backend integration:
```typescript
// Current (mock):
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));

// TODO: Replace with:
const response = await incidentService.submitIncident({
  ...values,
  incidentDate: `${values.incidentDate}T${values.incidentTime || '00:00'}:00`
});
```

---

### Routing
**TODO**: Add route configuration for `/report-incident` in router setup

**Example**:
```typescript
{
  path: '/report-incident',
  element: <IncidentReportPage />
}
```

---

### "My Reports" Page
**Status**: Not implemented in Phase 2A

**TODO**: Create MyReportsPage component in Phase 2E
- Route: `/my-reports`
- Shows identified user's submitted reports
- Limited detail view (no coordinator info, no notes)
- Status badges and timestamps only

## 🔄 NEXT PHASE: Phase 2B - Admin Dashboard

**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 16-20 hours

**Components Needed**:
1. IncidentFilters component
2. IncidentTable component (mirror VettingReviewGrid)
3. UnassignedQueueAlert component
4. IncidentPagination component
5. Admin Incident Dashboard page

**Pattern Sources**:
- VettingReviewGrid.tsx (table, filters, pagination)
- VettingStatusBadge.tsx (already adapted to IncidentStatusBadge)

**Backend Requirements**:
- GET /api/safety/admin/incidents (paginated, filtered)
- GET /api/safety/admin/dashboard (statistics, unassigned count)

---

## 📝 LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Mantine Form Validation
**Pattern Used**: Mantine's built-in `useForm` hook with custom validation functions

**Benefits**:
- No external validation library needed (Zod, Yup)
- Inline validation functions with access to form values
- Conditional validation (e.g., email required only if !isAnonymous)
- Real-time error display

**Lesson**: Mantine's native form validation is sufficient for most forms. Only reach for Zod/Yup when complex schema validation is needed.

---

### 2. Severity Card Selection Pattern
**Implementation**: Clickable Paper components with visual feedback

**Key Features**:
- Border color change on selection
- Background color highlight on selection
- SeverityBadge component embedded for visual consistency
- onClick handler updates form state

**Lesson**: For complex selection UI (not just dropdowns), clickable Paper components with visual state changes provide excellent UX.

---

### 3. Confirmation Screen State Management
**Pattern**: Local state (`isSubmitted`) controls view switching

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const [isSubmitted, setIsSubmitted] = useState(false);

if (isSubmitted) {
  return <ConfirmationView />;
}

return <FormView />;
```

**Lesson**: Simple state-based view switching is clearer than complex routing for single-page flows.

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL WARNINGS FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

### 1. NO Reference Number to Client
**CRITICAL**: Backend must NEVER return reference number to submitters (anonymous or identified).

Reference numbers are internal admin tracking only. UI must not display them to end users.

---

### 2. Status Enum Must Match Backend
**CRITICAL**: IncidentStatusBadge uses 5-stage enum. Backend MUST use same enum values.

Mismatched enums will cause badge rendering failures.

**Verify**:
- Backend enum: ReportSubmitted, InformationGathering, ReviewingFinalReport, OnHold, Closed
- Frontend matches exactly (case-sensitive)

---

### 3. Form Field Encryption
**BACKEND REQUIREMENT**: Sensitive fields must be encrypted at rest:
- description
- involvedParties
- witnesses
- contactEmail (if identified)
- contactPhone (if identified)

**Frontend**: Sends plaintext (HTTPS encryption in transit)
**Backend**: Encrypts before database storage

## 🚨 BACKEND DEVELOPER INTEGRATION CHECKLIST

Before Phase 2B begins, backend must provide:

- [ ] POST /api/safety/incidents endpoint (incident submission)
- [ ] CreateIncidentRequest DTO matches frontend form
- [ ] Response does NOT include reference number
- [ ] Sensitive fields encrypted before storage
- [ ] Anonymous reports stored without user linking
- [ ] Identified reports linked to user account
- [ ] Email notification to safety team on submission
- [ ] IncidentStatus enum uses 5-stage values
- [ ] IncidentSeverity enum uses 4 levels (Low, Medium, High, Critical)

**Once Backend Complete**: React Developer can integrate API calls and proceed to Phase 2B.
