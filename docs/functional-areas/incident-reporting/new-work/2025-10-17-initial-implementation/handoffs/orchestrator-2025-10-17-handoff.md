## üö® Critical Stakeholder Decisions Captured

These 5 decisions are embedded in the business requirements and MUST be honored in all subsequent phases:

### 1. Access Control: Per-Incident Assignment ‚úÖ
- **Decision**: ANY user (including non-admins) can be assigned as Incident Coordinator
- **Impact**: New permission model, coordinator assignment UI required
- **Validation**: Check that coordinators can only see ASSIGNED incidents

### 2. Stage Transitions: Guidance Only ‚úÖ
- **Decision**: Modal dialogs show reminders but DO NOT block progression
- **Impact**: 5 guidance modals needed (informative, not enforcing)
- **Validation**: Ensure modals can be dismissed, stage changes allowed without checklist completion

### 3. Google Drive: Phased Approach ‚úÖ
- **Decision**: Manual link management for MVP, design for future automation
- **Impact**: Simple checkbox reminder + link field in Phase 1
- **Validation**: Verify no Google Drive API integration in Phase 1 implementation

### 4. Anonymous Reports: Fully Anonymous ‚úÖ
- **Decision**: Absolutely NO follow-up capability for anonymous submissions
- **Impact**: No token system, no email option for anonymous reports
- **Validation**: Ensure anonymous reports have ZERO identifying information stored

### 5. Workflow Stages: 5-Stage Process ‚úÖ
- **Decision**: Report Submitted ‚Üí Information Gathering ‚Üí Reviewing Final Report ‚Üí On Hold ‚Üí Closed
- **Impact**: Backend enum migration required, API updates
- **Validation**: Current enum (New, InProgress, Resolved, Archived) MUST be replaced

## üö® Known Constraints & Blockers

### Technical Constraints
1. **Status Enum Migration**: Current `IncidentStatus` enum must be updated
   - Current: New, InProgress, Resolved, Archived
   - Required: ReportSubmitted, InformationGathering, ReviewingFinalReport, OnHold, Closed
   - Impact: Migration script needed, all API references updated

2. **New Entity Required**: `IncidentNote` entity doesn't exist yet
   - Must mirror `ApplicationNoteDto` from vetting system
   - Includes: Content, Type (Manual/System), IsPrivate, AuthorId, Timestamps

3. **Access Control Updates**: Current model doesn't support per-incident coordinator assignment
   - Need: CoordinatorId field on SafetyIncident
   - Need: Permission checks for assigned-only access

### Process Blockers
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **MANDATORY HUMAN APPROVAL** required before Phase 2
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **NO DESIGN WORK** can start until approval received
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **NO IMPLEMENTATION WORK** until design approved

## üìä Effort Estimates (From Business Requirements)

| Phase | Estimated Hours | Status |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Phase 1: Requirements | 8 hours | ‚úÖ Complete |
| Phase 2: Design | 32 hours | ‚è∏Ô∏è Blocked |
| Phase 3: Implementation | 80 hours | Pending |
| Phase 4: Testing | 40 hours | Pending |
| Phase 5: Finalization | 12 hours | Pending |
| **Total** | **172 hours** (~4.3 weeks) | In Progress |

---

## üé® Design Phase Sequencing (Critical!)

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE FOR PHASE 2:**

1. **UI Design FIRST** ‚úÖ Must happen before any other design work
   - Review existing wireframe
   - Create admin dashboard mockups
   - Design incident detail page with notes
   - Design 5 guidance modals
   - Create status badge specifications
   - **MANDATORY HUMAN REVIEW AFTER UI DESIGN** ‚è∏Ô∏è

2. **Post-UI Approval ONLY**:
   - Database design (status enum update, new IncidentNote entity)
   - API endpoint specifications
   - Technical architecture updates

**Rationale**: UI design decisions fundamentally inform all technical specifications. User interface patterns determine data models, API contracts, and technical architecture.

## üîç Validation Checklist for Next Agents

### For UI Designer (Next Agent)
- [ ] Read business requirements handoff FIRST
- [ ] Review existing wireframe (use almost exactly as-is)
- [ ] Study vetting system UI patterns (VettingApplicationDetail lines 501-579 for notes section)
- [ ] Create mockups for admin dashboard (list/filtering like VettingReviewGrid)
- [ ] Design incident detail page (coordinator view with notes)
- [ ] Design 5 guidance modals (one per stage transition)
- [ ] Create status badge variants (severity + workflow status)
- [ ] Design anonymous status check page (public, reference number lookup)
- [ ] Create handoff document for database-designer
- [ ] PAUSE for human UI approval before other design work

### For Database Designer (After UI Approval)
- [ ] Read business requirements handoff
- [ ] Read UI designer handoff
- [ ] Update IncidentStatus enum (5 new values)
- [ ] Create IncidentNote entity (mirror ApplicationNoteDto)
- [ ] Add CoordinatorId to SafetyIncident
- [ ] Create migration scripts
- [ ] Document breaking changes
- [ ] Create handoff document for backend-developer

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Anonymous Follow-up Trap
**Mistake**: Implementing any follow-up mechanism for anonymous reports
**Prevention**: Fully anonymous = truly one-way. NO tokens, NO emails, NO status updates except public reference lookup
**Validation**: Verify anonymous submissions store ZERO identifying information

### 2. Stage Enforcement Trap
**Mistake**: Creating mandatory checklist validation that blocks stage transitions
**Prevention**: Guidance modals are INFORMATIVE ONLY, not blocking
**Validation**: Ensure all modals have dismiss/continue options without validation

### 3. Google Drive Integration Trap
**Mistake**: Attempting Phase 1 API integration with Google Drive
**Prevention**: Phase 1 = manual checkbox reminder + link field ONLY
**Validation**: No Google Drive API client library in Phase 1 dependencies

### 4. Status Enum Migration Trap
**Mistake**: Creating new fields instead of updating existing enum
**Prevention**: UPDATE IncidentStatus enum in-place with migration
**Validation**: Verify all existing incidents migrated to new status values

### 5. Vetting Pattern Deviation Trap
**Mistake**: Creating completely new UI patterns instead of mirroring vetting system
**Prevention**: Study VettingApplicationDetail and VettingReviewGrid, replicate for consistency
**Validation**: UI mockups should look similar to vetting admin screens

---

## üìà Success Metrics to Track

1. **Submission Rate**: >80% completion without errors
2. **Response Time**: <24 hours submission to coordinator assignment
3. **Anonymous Adoption**: >60% anonymous submissions (privacy trust)
4. **Coordinator Efficiency**: <7 days average submitted to closed
5. **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating on safety reporting process
