## 🔑 KEY THEMES ACROSS HANDOFFS

### Privacy Restrictions (Recurring)

**From Multiple Handoffs**:
- NO reference number displayed to users (MyReportCard, MyReportsPage, MyReportDetailView)
- NO coordinator information in user views (MyReportDetailView)
- Anonymous reports fully anonymous (no tracking, no follow-up)
- Backend authorization MUST verify report ownership

**Why Critical**: Privacy protection for all parties, stakeholder requirement

---

### Vetting System Pattern Reuse (Recurring)

**From Multiple Handoffs**:
- IncidentNote entity mirrors ApplicationNoteDto pattern exactly
- Notes UI mirrors VettingApplicationDetail (lines 501-579)
- Dashboard mirrors VettingReviewGrid (list/filtering)
- Admin detail page mirrors vetting detail page structure

**Why Critical**: UI/UX consistency across admin features

---

### Google Drive Phase 1 Approach (Recurring)

**From Multiple Handoffs**:
- Manual link entry ONLY (no API automation)
- GoogleDriveSection with simple text inputs
- GoogleDriveLinksModal for editing
- System notes document link changes
- Phase 2 will automate with Google Drive API

**Why Critical**: Stakeholder decision - phased approach to avoid complexity

---

### System Note Generation (Recurring)

**From Multiple Handoffs**:
- Auto-generated on incident creation, status change, coordinator assignment, Drive link updates
- Purple background, read-only, IconRobot
- Content format: "Action performed: details"
- AuthorId tracks who triggered (except true system notes)

**Why Critical**: Audit trail for all incident activities

---

### Deferred Navigation Pattern (New in Phase 2E)

**From React Phase 2E Handoff**:
- Use setTimeout for navigation from click handlers
- Pattern: `setTimeout(() => navigate('/path'), 0);`
- Required for React Router Outlet to properly unmount/mount
- Applied to MyReportCard component

**Why Critical**: Lessons learned from react-developer-lessons-learned.md

---

## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS DOCUMENTED

### 1. Anonymous Follow-up Trap

**Documented In**: Business Requirements Handoff, Orchestrator Handoff

**Mistake**: Implementing any follow-up mechanism for anonymous reports

**Prevention**: Fully anonymous = truly one-way. NO tokens, NO emails, NO status updates except public reference lookup

---

### 2. Stage Enforcement Trap

**Documented In**: Business Requirements Handoff, Orchestrator Handoff

**Mistake**: Creating mandatory checklist validation that blocks stage transitions

**Prevention**: Guidance modals are INFORMATIVE ONLY, not blocking. All modals have dismiss/continue options without validation.

---

### 3. Google Drive Integration Trap

**Documented In**: Business Requirements Handoff, Database Designer Handoff

**Mistake**: Attempting Phase 1 API integration with Google Drive

**Prevention**: Phase 1 = manual checkbox reminder + link field ONLY. No Google Drive API client library in Phase 1 dependencies.

---

### 4. Status Enum Migration Trap

**Documented In**: Database Designer Handoff, Backend Developer Handoff

**Mistake**: Creating new fields instead of updating existing enum

**Prevention**: UPDATE IncidentStatus enum in-place with migration. Verify all existing incidents migrated to new status values.

---

### 5. Vetting Pattern Deviation Trap

**Documented In**: UI Designer Handoff

**Mistake**: Creating completely new UI patterns instead of mirroring vetting system

**Prevention**: Study VettingApplicationDetail and VettingReviewGrid, replicate for consistency.

---
