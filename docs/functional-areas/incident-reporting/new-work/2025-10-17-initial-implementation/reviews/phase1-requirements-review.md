## ✅ Critical Stakeholder Decisions Implemented

Based on your specific guidance, these decisions are embedded in the requirements:

### 1. **Access Control: Per-Incident Assignment** ✅
- **Decision**: ANY user (including non-admins) can be assigned as Incident Coordinator
- **Implementation**: New permission model allowing temporary coordinator role per incident
- **Impact**: Requires coordinator assignment UI, permission checks, access control updates

### 2. **Stage Transitions: Guidance Only** ✅
- **Decision**: Modal dialogs show reminders but DO NOT block progression
- **Implementation**: 5 guidance modals (one per stage transition) with checklists/reminders
- **Impact**: UX design for informative modals, no validation enforcement

### 3. **Google Drive: Phased Approach** ✅
- **Decision**: Manual link management for MVP, design for future automation
- **Implementation**: Phase 1 = checkbox reminder + manual link field, Phase 2 = API integration
- **Impact**: Simpler Phase 1 scope, clear future enhancement path

### 4. **Anonymous Reports: Fully Anonymous** ✅
- **Decision**: Absolutely NO follow-up capability for anonymous submissions
- **Implementation**: Anonymous = truly one-way, no token system, no email option
- **Impact**: Clear privacy guarantee, simpler implementation, reference number lookup only

### 5. **Workflow Stages: 5-Stage Process** ✅
- **Decision**: Report Submitted → Information Gathering → Reviewing Final Report → On Hold → Closed
- **Implementation**: NEW status enum replacing current (New, InProgress, Resolved, Archived)
- **Impact**: Backend migration required, all status references need updating

---

## 🔍 Key Requirements Highlights

### Workflow Stages
1. **Report Submitted**: Initial state after submission (auto-assigned)
2. **Information Gathering**: Coordinator assigned, investigation begins
3. **Reviewing Final Report**: Draft resolution ready for review
4. **On Hold**: Can be entered from any stage (temporary pause)
5. **Closed**: Final resolution complete

### User Roles & Capabilities
| Role | Submit Reports | View All | Assign Coordinators | Manage Incidents | View Notes |
|------|---------------|----------|---------------------|------------------|------------|
| Anonymous Reporter | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Identified Reporter | ✅ | Own only | ❌ | Own only | Own only |
| Incident Coordinator | ✅ | Assigned only | ❌ | Assigned only | Assigned only |
| Admin | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Data Encryption Strategy
**Encrypted Fields** (sensitive data):
- Description
- Involved parties
- Witnesses
- Contact email (if provided)
- Contact phone (if provided)

**Non-Encrypted Fields** (operational data):
- Reference number
- Status
- Severity
- Dates (incident, reported, created, updated)
- Location (general area only)
- Assignment information

### Success Metrics
1. **Submission Rate**: >80% of users can complete form without errors
2. **Response Time**: <24 hours from submission to coordinator assignment
3. **Anonymous Adoption**: >60% of reports submitted anonymously (privacy trust indicator)
4. **Coordinator Efficiency**: Average <7 days from submitted to closed
5. **User Satisfaction**: >4.5/5 rating on safety reporting process

## 🎨 Design Foundation

### Existing Wireframe
**Location**: [/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/design/wireframes/incident-report-visual.html](file:///home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/design/wireframes/incident-report-visual.html)

**Assessment**: Excellent design, use almost exactly as-is
- ✅ Anonymous toggle implementation
- ✅ Severity level selection
- ✅ Form field organization
- ✅ Privacy notices
- ✅ Support resource section

**Minor Updates Needed**:
- Update severity options to match new 4-level system (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Adjust incident type selector to match business requirements
- Add reference number display in confirmation

### Vetting System Patterns to Mirror
**Admin List/Grid**: [VettingReviewGrid.tsx](file:///home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/apps/web/src/features/admin/vetting/components/VettingReviewGrid.tsx)
- Filtering by status, severity, date range
- Sort capabilities
- Quick action buttons
- Status badge styling

**Detail Page with Notes**: [VettingApplicationDetail.tsx](file:///home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/apps/web/src/features/admin/vetting/components/VettingApplicationDetail.tsx) (lines 501-579)
- Notes section layout
- System-generated vs manual notes
- Timestamp and author display
- Add note form

**Modal Actions**: [OnHoldModal.tsx](file:///home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/apps/web/src/features/admin/vetting/components/OnHoldModal.tsx)
- Confirmation workflow
- Reason/notes input
- Cancel vs confirm buttons
