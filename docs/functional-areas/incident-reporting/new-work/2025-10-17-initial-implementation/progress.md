# Incident Reporting - Implementation Progress
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-10-17 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Orchestrator Agent -->
<!-- Status: Active - Phase 1 Requirements -->

## Overview
Complete Incident Reporting System implementation for WitchCityRope platform. This feature enables administrators to document and track safety incidents, consent violations, and community concerns.

## Feature Context
- **Feature Type**: Feature Development
- **Priority**: High - Community safety critical
- **Similar Patterns**: Vetting System (multi-phase workflow, admin-focused)
- **Technology Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + .NET Minimal API + PostgreSQL
- **Target Completion**: TBD after requirements analysis

## Workflow Quality Gates
| Phase | Quality Gate Target | Current Status | Completion Date |
|-------|---------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Phase 1: Requirements | 5% → 95% | 100% ✅ - **AWAITING APPROVAL** | 2025-10-17 |
| Phase 2: Design | 0% → 90% | 0% ⏸️ - Blocked | - |
| Phase 3: Implementation | 0% → 85% | 0% - Not Started | - |
| Phase 4: Testing | 0% → 100% | 0% - Not Started | - |
| Phase 5: Finalization | 0% → 100% | 0% - Not Started | - |

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Requirements Analysis

### Phase 1 Objectives
- [x] Business requirements document creation

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Business Requirements Agent - Create business requirements document
2. **After Requirements**: Human review and approval
3. **Then**: UI Designer - Create wireframes and design specifications
4. **Then**: Database Designer - Schema design
5. **Then**: Continue through phases 3-5

## Notes
- Feature follows standard 5-phase workflow pattern
- Similar to vetting system in complexity and admin focus
- Community safety critical - requires thorough requirements analysis
- Stakeholder input essential for incident categorization and severity levels
