## ‚ùå CRITICAL BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Production)

### 1. Backend API Endpoints Not Implemented

**Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKING**

**Issue**: 0 of 12 API endpoints implemented

**Required Endpoints**:
- [ ] GET /api/safety/incidents
- [ ] POST /api/safety/incidents
- [ ] GET /api/safety/incidents/{id}
- [ ] PUT /api/safety/incidents/{id}/status
- [ ] PUT /api/safety/incidents/{id}/coordinator
- [ ] PUT /api/safety/incidents/{id}/drive-links
- [ ] GET /api/safety/incidents/{id}/notes
- [ ] POST /api/safety/incidents/{id}/notes
- [ ] PUT /api/safety/notes/{id}
- [ ] DELETE /api/safety/notes/{id}
- [ ] GET /api/safety/my-reports
- [ ] GET /api/safety/my-reports/{id}

**Estimated Effort**: 40-60 hours

**Assigned To**: Backend Developer

**Impact**: Frontend cannot function without backend APIs

---

### 2. Database Migrations Not Applied

**Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKING**

**Issue**: Migrations prepared but not executed

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Run EF Core migration: `dotnet ef database update`
- [ ] Run data migration script: `MigrateIncidentStatusEnum.sql`
- [ ] Verify schema changes in development database
- [ ] Test rollback procedure
- [ ] Apply to staging environment
- [ ] Verify no data loss

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Assigned To**: DevOps / Database Administrator

**Impact**: Backend code will fail at runtime without schema updates

---

### 3. Authentication/Authorization Not Configured

**Status**: ‚ùå **BLOCKING**

**Issue**: API endpoints lack authentication/authorization middleware

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Configure auth middleware for safety endpoints
- [ ] Implement admin role check
- [ ] Implement coordinator assignment check
- [ ] Implement report ownership verification
- [ ] Test authentication flows (admin, coordinator, user)
- [ ] Test authorization edge cases (403 scenarios)

**Estimated Effort**: 8-12 hours

**Assigned To**: Backend Developer

**Impact**: Security vulnerability, unauthorized access possible

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY ISSUES (Should Fix Before Production)

### 4. Pre-Existing TypeScript Errors

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Issue**: 10 TypeScript errors exist in codebase (NOT from incident reporting)

**Files Affected**: Various existing files (not incident reporting)

**Current State**: Build succeeds with errors

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Identify all 10 TypeScript errors
- [ ] Fix or suppress each error
- [ ] Verify build succeeds with 0 errors
- [ ] Add linting to CI/CD to prevent future errors

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Assigned To**: React Developer

**Impact**: Code quality, potential runtime issues, developer confusion

---

### 5. Modal Test Infrastructure Issues

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Issue**: 68 modal tests failing across project (NOT incident reporting specific)

**Root Cause**: Mantine Modal rendering pattern mismatch in tests

**Current State**: Incident reporting modal tests passing, but general modal test pattern needs fix

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Investigate Mantine Modal test rendering issues
- [ ] Fix modal test pattern across all test files
- [ ] Verify all 68 failing tests now pass
- [ ] Document correct modal testing pattern

**Estimated Effort**: 6-8 hours

**Assigned To**: Test Developer

**Impact**: Test suite reliability, false positives/negatives

---

## üîß MEDIUM PRIORITY ISSUES (Fix Before or Shortly After Launch)

### 6. Missing Page-Level Tests

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Issue**: 3 page tests missing

**Missing Tests**:
- [ ] IncidentReportPage (using IncidentReportForm)
- [ ] Full MyReportsPage coverage (7 tests exist, need more)
- [ ] Full MyReportDetailView coverage (14 tests exist, need more)

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Add page-level tests for routing
- [ ] Add page-level tests for layout
- [ ] Test page integration with auth system
- [ ] Test error states (404, 403, etc.)

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Assigned To**: Test Developer

**Impact**: Lower - component tests cover logic, page tests cover routing/layout

---

### 7. Google Drive User Documentation

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Issue**: Google Drive Phase 1 manual process not documented for users

**Required Actions**:
- [ ] Create user guide for Google Drive folder creation
- [ ] Document manual link entry process
- [ ] Create admin training materials
- [ ] Update help documentation with Drive process
- [ ] Add tooltips/hints in UI for Drive section

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

**Assigned To**: Technical Writer / UI Designer

**Impact**: User confusion, support burden

---

### 8. Integration Testing Not Run

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Issue**: No integration tests run yet (awaiting backend)

**Required Tests**:
- [ ] E2E workflow: Submit incident ‚Üí Admin review ‚Üí Coordinator assignment ‚Üí Closure
- [ ] Authentication flows (admin, coordinator, user, anonymous)
- [ ] Authorization checks (report ownership, coordinator-only access)
- [ ] Real-time updates (status changes, new notes)
- [ ] Form validation with backend validation
- [ ] Multi-user scenarios (concurrent edits)

**Estimated Effort**: 20-30 hours

**Assigned To**: Test Developer

**Impact**: Unknown integration issues, potential production bugs

---

## üîí SECURITY REVIEW REQUIRED

### Security Checklist

- [ ] **Authentication**: httpOnly cookie-based auth working correctly
- [ ] **Authorization**: Role-based access control (admin, coordinator, user)
- [ ] **Report Ownership**: Backend verifies user owns report before showing details
- [ ] **Anonymous Privacy**: Anonymous reports have ZERO identifying information
- [ ] **XSS Prevention**: Backend HTML sanitization for description, notes
- [ ] **CSRF Protection**: CSRF tokens on all POST/PUT/DELETE requests
- [ ] **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries (EF Core handles this)
- [ ] **Input Validation**: All input validated on backend (not just frontend)
- [ ] **Error Messages**: No sensitive information in error messages
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: All state changes logged (system notes)

**Estimated Effort**: 4-6 hours

**Assigned To**: Security Engineer / Backend Developer

---

## ‚ö° PERFORMANCE TESTING REQUIRED

### Performance Checklist

- [ ] **Load Testing**: Concurrent users (10, 50, 100 users)
- [ ] **Database Performance**: Query execution times <200ms
- [ ] **API Response Times**: All endpoints <200ms (95th percentile)
- [ ] **Large Dataset**: Test with 1,000+ incidents, 10,000+ notes
- [ ] **Pagination**: Verify pagination works with large datasets
- [ ] **Index Usage**: Verify database indexes being used (EXPLAIN ANALYZE)
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory during heavy load
- [ ] **Concurrent Edits**: Test multiple users editing same incident

**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 hours

**Assigned To**: Performance Engineer / Backend Developer
