# Business Requirements: Zustand State Management Validation
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-19 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary
This technical validation project establishes and proves state management patterns using Zustand for the WitchCityRope React application. The validation will create a decision framework for global vs local state, establish performance benchmarks, and document reusable patterns before full feature development begins.

## Business Context
### Problem Statement
The WitchCityRope platform migration from Blazor Server to React requires a robust state management solution to handle user authentication, UI state, form data, and real-time updates. Without validated patterns, feature development risks:
- Inconsistent state handling across components
- Performance degradation from unnecessary re-renders
- Debugging difficulties in complex state interactions
- Scalability issues as the application grows

### Business Value
- **Development Velocity**: Proven patterns accelerate feature development
- **User Experience**: Optimal performance with <16ms state updates
- **Developer Experience**: Clear debugging tools and state visibility
- **Platform Reliability**: Predictable state behavior across all features
- **Future Scalability**: Architecture supports community growth to 500+ users

### Success Metrics
- All state patterns validated with working proof-of-concept code
- Performance benchmarks documented and achieved (<16ms updates)
- DevTools integration functional for debugging
- Decision framework established for state architecture choices
- Documentation complete for development team adoption

## User Stories

### Story 1: State Architecture Decision Framework
**As a** React developer on the WitchCityRope team
**I want to** understand when to use global vs local state
**So that** I can make consistent architectural decisions during feature development

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a new feature requirement
- When I need to decide on state management approach
- Then I have clear criteria for choosing global, local, or hybrid patterns
- And the decision framework includes performance implications
- And examples demonstrate each pattern type

### Story 2: Authentication State Management
**As a** platform user
**I want** my authentication state to persist across navigation and page refreshes
**So that** I don't lose my login session while using the platform

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am logged into the platform
- When I navigate between pages or refresh the browser
- Then my authentication state remains intact
- And my user role and permissions are maintained
- And token refresh happens transparently
- And logout properly clears all auth state

### Story 3: UI State Persistence
**As a** community member using the platform
**I want** my UI preferences (sidebar state, form data, filters) to persist during my session
**So that** my workflow isn't interrupted by state loss

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have configured UI elements (sidebar open, form partially filled)
- When I navigate to different pages
- Then my UI state preferences are maintained
- And form data is preserved during navigation
- And filters/search state persists appropriately

### Story 4: Real-Time State Updates
**As a** teacher managing event registrations
**I want** to see real-time updates when members register for my events
**So that** I can monitor capacity and manage waitlists effectively

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have an event management page open
- When other users register for events
- Then my view updates automatically without page refresh
- And the updates are received within 100ms of the change
- And state conflicts are resolved consistently

### Story 5: Performance Monitoring and Debugging
**As a** developer working on WitchCityRope features
**I want** visibility into state changes and performance metrics
**So that** I can identify and fix performance issues quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the application is running in development mode
- When state changes occur throughout the application
- Then I can see state updates in browser DevTools
- And performance metrics show update timings
- And state history is available for debugging

## Business Rules
1. **Performance Standard**: All state updates must complete within 16ms to maintain 60 FPS user experience
2. **Persistence Strategy**: Authentication state persists across browser sessions; UI state persists within session only
3. **State Isolation**: Component-specific state remains local; cross-component shared state uses global stores
4. **Security Compliance**: Authentication tokens handled securely without localStorage exposure
5. **Error Recovery**: State management includes error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
6. **Memory Management**: State stores properly clean up resources on component unmount

## Constraints & Assumptions
### Constraints
- Technical: Must integrate with existing React + TypeScript + Vite setup
- Technical: Must work with existing .NET API authentication system
- Business: Cannot impact current authentication workflows during validation
- Budget: Validation phase limited to 1 week of development time

### Assumptions
- Developers have React hooks and TypeScript experience
- DevTools usage acceptable in development environment
- State management patterns will be reused across multiple features
- Performance requirements based on community size up to 500 concurrent users

## Security & Privacy Requirements
- Authentication state management must not expose JWT tokens to XSS attacks
- User role and permission state must be validated server-side
- Sensitive user data not persisted in browser storage beyond session requirements
- State management debugging tools disabled in production environment

## Compliance Requirements
- State persistence must respect user privacy preferences
- Authentication state handling must comply with existing security patterns
- Error logging must not expose sensitive user information
- DevTools integration must be development-only

## User Impact Analysis
| User Type | Impact | Priority |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Admin | Improved dashboard performance, real-time updates | High |
| Teacher | Faster event management, persistent UI state | High |
| Vetted Member | Smooth navigation, maintained preferences | Medium |
| General Member | Better form experience, consistent UI | Medium |
| Guest | Faster page loads, responsive interface | Low |

## Examples/Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Authentication Flow
1. User logs in through authentication form
2. Auth store updates with user data, roles, and session info
3. Navigation components reactively update based on user role
4. Protected routes automatically redirect unauthorized users
5. Session refresh happens transparently without UI disruption

### Scenario 2: Event Registration State Management
1. User browses event list with applied filters
2. Filter state persists as user navigates between event details
3. Registration form maintains partial data during navigation
4. Real-time updates show changing event capacity
5. Successful registration updates multiple related state stores

### Scenario 3: Admin Dashboard State Coordination
1. Admin opens user management dashboard
2. Global UI store maintains sidebar and panel states
3. User list state loaded and cached efficiently
4. Filter and search state preserved during detail view navigation
5. Bulk operations update state optimistically with rollback capability

### Scenario 4: Teacher Event Management
1. Teacher creates new workshop event
2. Form state persists through multi-step creation process
3. Event store immediately reflects new event
4. Dashboard updates show real-time registration count
5. Capacity management triggers UI updates across related components

## State Architecture Decision Framework

### Global State Criteria
Use global Zustand stores when:
- Data is shared across multiple route components
- State needs to persist across navigation
- Real-time updates affect multiple UI areas
- Authentication and authorization data

**Examples**: User authentication, notification queue, global UI preferences

### Local State Criteria
Use React useState/useReducer when:
- State is component-specific and not shared
- Temporary UI state (form validation, loading indicators)
- Performance-critical frequent updates
- Component lifecycle matches state lifecycle

**Examples**: Form field values, component visibility toggles, local loading states

### Hybrid Patterns
Combine global and local state when:
- Global state provides data, local state manages UI interaction
- Complex forms with both persistent and temporary state
- Real-time data with local user customizations

**Examples**: Event registration (global event data, local form state), user dashboard (global user data, local widget preferences)

## Performance Requirements
- **State Update Performance**: <16ms for UI-blocking updates
- **Store Subscription Time**: <1ms for component subscription setup
- **Memory Usage**: <10MB additional overhead for state management
- **Bundle Size Impact**: <5KB additional JavaScript for Zustand integration
- **Development Tool Impact**: <2ms additional overhead in development mode
