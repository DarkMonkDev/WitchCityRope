**Phase**: Design & Architecture (Complete)
**Feature**: Vetting System - Member Approval Workflow
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Phase 2 Summary

Successfully completed all design and architecture documentation for the Vetting System feature extraction from legacy API to modern API architecture.

## Completed Deliverables

### 1. UI Design ✅
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/design/vetting-system-ui-design.md`
- Privacy-first design approach
- Mobile-responsive layouts for all screens
- Mantine v7 component specifications
- Accessibility considerations (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Anonymous application flow
- Reviewer dashboard wireframes

### 2. Functional Specification ✅
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/requirements/vetting-system-functional-spec.md`
- Complete API endpoint specifications (17 endpoints)
- Business rules and validation logic
- Data models and DTOs
- Integration requirements
- Error handling specifications
- Notification templates

### 3. Database Design ✅
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/design/vetting-system-database-design.md`
- 11 entity definitions with full schema
- Privacy-focused architecture with encryption
- PostgreSQL optimization with strategic indexes
- Migration strategy (4-phase approach)
- Audit trail implementation
- Performance considerations

### 4. Technical Architecture ✅
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/design/vetting-system-technical-architecture.md`
- Vertical Slice Architecture design
- Service layer specifications (5 core services)
- Security implementation (AES-256-GCM)
- Performance optimization strategy
- Testing approach with TestContainers
- 4-phase implementation plan

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Privacy Architecture**
   - All PII encrypted with AES-256-GCM
   - Anonymous application support
   - Secure token-based status tracking
   - No PII in logs or notifications

2. **Technology Stack**
   - Backend: .NET 9 Minimal API
   - Frontend: React + TypeScript + Mantine v7
   - Database: PostgreSQL with EF Core 9
   - Testing: TestContainers for all DB tests
   - Authentication: Cookie-based for users

3. **Performance Targets**
   - GET requests: < 200ms
   - POST/PUT requests: < 1000ms
   - Dashboard load: < 3 seconds
   - Reference response: < 500ms

4. **Security Measures**
   - HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
   - Role-based authorization
   - Encrypted sensitive data
   - Comprehensive audit logging
   - Secure token generation

## Next Phase: Implementation (Phase 3)

### Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Backend Infrastructure** (Week 1)
   - Database migrations
   - Entity configurations
   - Encryption service setup
   - Base service classes

2. **Core Services** (Week 2)
   - VettingService implementation
   - ReferenceService implementation
   - ReviewerService implementation
   - Integration with existing services

3. **API Endpoints** (Week 3)
   - Public endpoints (application, status)
   - Reviewer endpoints (dashboard, decisions)
   - Admin endpoints (analytics, management)
   - Validation and error handling

4. **Frontend Components** (Week 4)
   - Application form components
   - Status tracking interface
   - Reviewer dashboard
   - Admin management screens

5. **Integration & Testing** (Week 5)
   - End-to-end workflow testing
   - Security validation
   - Performance optimization
   - Documentation updates

### Implementation Agents Required

1. **backend-developer**: Implement backend services and API endpoints
2. **react-developer**: Build frontend components and pages
3. **test-developer**: Create comprehensive test suites
4. **test-executor**: Run and validate all tests

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Privacy Risk**
   - Mitigation: Encryption implemented from start
   - Testing: Security audit before deployment

2. **Performance Risk**
   - Mitigation: Caching strategy defined
   - Testing: Load testing with realistic data

3. **Integration Risk**
   - Mitigation: Following established patterns
   - Testing: Integration tests with existing services

## Success Criteria

- All 17 API endpoints functional
- 100% test coverage for critical paths
- < 200ms response times for GET requests
- Zero security vulnerabilities
- Complete audit trail for all operations
- Mobile-responsive UI on all screens
