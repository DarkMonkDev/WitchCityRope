### 📋 Architecture Migration Strategy

**Vertical Slice Implementation Pattern**:
```
/apps/api/Features/[FeatureName]/
├── Services/[FeatureName]Service.cs      # Business logic
├── Endpoints/[FeatureName]Endpoints.cs   # API endpoints  
├── Models/[Request/Response]Dto.cs       # Data transfer objects
└── Validation/[Request]Validator.cs      # Input validation
```

**Key Principles**:
- Simplify architecture (remove MediatR/CQRS complexity)
- Direct Entity Framework usage
- Minimal API patterns
- Preserve critical business logic
- Enhanced security patterns

## Critical Findings

### 🚨 CRITICAL PRIORITY: Safety System
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED in modern API
**Business Impact**: Legal compliance requirement for community safety

**Key Components**:
- Anonymous incident reporting with data encryption
- Severity-based alert escalation (Critical/High → Immediate alerts)
- Reference number system (CON-20250912-1234)
- Audit trail with timestamped actions
- Safety team on-call notification system

**Risk**: Community operates without formal incident reporting - potential legal liability

### 💻 HIGH PRIORITY: CheckIn System
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED in modern API
**Business Impact**: Core event functionality missing

**Key Components**:
- Multi-modal check-in (QR codes, confirmation codes, manual lookup)
- Staff role validation (CheckInStaff, Organizer, Admin)
- Event timing validation (30-minute early window)
- Waiver requirement validation
- First-time attendee detection
- Comprehensive attendee information (dietary, accessibility, emergency contacts)

### 👥 HIGH PRIORITY: Vetting System
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED in modern API
**Business Impact**: Community member approval workflow missing

**Key Components**:
- Application submission with references (minimum 2 required)
- External reference validation via secure tokens
- Multi-stage review process with scoring (safety 1-10, community fit 1-10)
- Interview scheduling capability
- Automated status transitions and notifications

### 💳 MEDIUM PRIORITY: Enhanced Payments
**Status**: BASIC IMPLEMENTATION exists in modern API
**Gap Analysis**: Missing advanced features

**Modern API Lacks**:
- Stripe customer management
- Payment method storage and reuse
- Post-payment automation
- Comprehensive metadata tracking
- Advanced error handling

## Technical Architecture Analysis

### Modern API Status Assessment
**Location**: `/apps/api/Features/`
**Architecture**: Vertical slice with minimal API patterns
**Performance**: <50ms response times maintained

**Current Features**:
- ✅ Authentication (basic JWT + cookies)
- ✅ Events (basic CRUD)
- ✅ Health checks
- ✅ Users management
- ✅ Shared utilities

**Missing Critical Features**:
- ❌ Safety incident reporting
- ❌ Event check-in system
- ❌ Member vetting workflow
- ❌ Advanced payment processing
- ❌ User dashboard and statistics

### Legacy API Assessment
**Location**: `/src/WitchCityRope.Api/Features/`
**Architecture**: Traditional layered with repositories
**Status**: DORMANT but contains valuable business logic

**Valuable Assets**:
- Comprehensive business rules and validation
- Production-ready safety and vetting workflows
- Advanced payment provider integration
- Complex event management features
- Security patterns (encryption, authentication)

## Business Impact Analysis

### Critical Business Functions Missing
1. **Safety Compliance**: No incident reporting system
2. **Event Operations**: No check-in process for events
3. **Community Management**: No member vetting system
4. **Revenue Optimization**: Limited payment processing capabilities

### User Experience Gaps
1. **Event Staff**: Cannot check in attendees efficiently
2. **Safety Team**: No formal incident reporting workflow
3. **Vetting Team**: No application review system
4. **Members**: No personalized dashboard or statistics

### Legal/Compliance Risks
1. **Incident Reporting**: Potential liability without formal safety reporting
2. **Data Protection**: Need encryption for sensitive incident data
3. **Community Standards**: Vetting system ensures member quality

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Critical Safety Infrastructure (Week 1)
**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Focus**: Legal compliance and community safety
