# Orchestrator Handoff - API Cleanup Phase 1 Complete

<!-- Created: 2025-09-12 -->
<!-- Agent: Orchestrator -->
<!-- Phase: 1 - Requirements Analysis COMPLETE -->
<!-- Status: BLOCKED - Awaiting Human Review -->

## Handoff Summary

Phase 1 Requirements Analysis is **COMPLETE** and **BLOCKED** awaiting mandatory human review. Critical finding: Safety incident reporting system is completely missing from modern API, creating legal compliance risk.

## Work Completed

### âœ… Phase 1 Achievements
1. **Technical Requirements Document** created with corrected specifications:
   - Cookie-based user authentication (NOT JWT)
   - TestContainers for all testing (NO in-memory)
   - Incremental commit strategy defined

2. **Legacy API Feature Analysis** completed by backend-developer:
   - 7 major feature systems analyzed
   - Priority matrix created (EXTRACT/ARCHIVE/DISCARD)
   - Critical safety system gap identified

3. **Human Review Document** prepared:
   - Comprehensive findings summary
   - Risk assessment with mitigations
   - Approval checklist ready

4. **Git Management** properly executed:
   - Feature branch created: `feature/api-cleanup-2025-09-12`
   - Initial planning committed
   - Clean working directory maintained

## Critical Findings

### ðŸš¨ HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Safety System Missing** - Legal compliance risk identified:
- No incident reporting in modern API
- Required for community safety documentation
- Must be first implementation priority

### Feature Extraction Priorities
1. **CRITICAL**: Safety System (Week 1)
2. **HIGH**: CheckIn System, Vetting System (Weeks 2-3)
3. **MEDIUM**: Events Enhancement, Dashboard, Payments (Weeks 3-4)

## Current Status

### Workflow Position
- **Phase 1**: âœ… COMPLETE (100% quality gate achieved)
- **Human Review**: ðŸ”´ REQUIRED (Blocking Phase 2)
- **Next Phase**: Design & Planning (Cannot start until approval)

### Documentation Structure
All work properly organized at:
`/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/`

## Next Agent Actions

### Upon Human Approval

#### UI Designer (FIRST in Phase 2)
- Design interfaces for Safety system
- Create CheckIn system mockups
- Review document location: `/reviews/phase1-requirements-review.md`

#### Backend Developer
- Prepare technical specifications
- Plan vertical slice implementations
- Review safety system requirements

#### Database Designer
- Analyze schema requirements for new features
- Plan migration scripts
- Consider audit trail needs

## Key Decisions Pending

1. **Safety System Scope**: Full features or core reporting only?
2. **CheckIn Complexity**: QR codes essential or manual sufficient?
3. **Vetting Simplification**: Can multi-stage be simplified initially?
4. **Payment Timeline**: Defer to Week 4 or needed sooner?

## Risk Mitigation Active

- **Legal Risk**: Safety system prioritized for Week 1
- **Rollback Strategy**: Incremental commits implemented
- **Testing Approach**: TestContainers configured
- **Performance**: Light testing only (small user base)

## File Registry Updates
âœ… All files properly registered in `/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`

## Handoff Verification

### Documents Created
- [x] Technical requirements with corrections
- [x] Legacy API feature analysis
- [x] Human review document
- [x] Progress tracking updated
- [x] All handoff documents

### Process Compliance
- [x] Workflow orchestration process followed
- [x] Documentation organization standard maintained
- [x] Agent handoff template used
- [x] File registry maintained
- [x] Absolute paths throughout

## Critical Reminders for Next Phase

1. **DO NOT PROCEED** without human approval
2. **UI Design MUST be first** in Phase 2
3. **Maintain cookie authentication** (not JWT for users)
4. **Use TestContainers** for all database testing
5. **Commit incrementally** for rollback capability

**Handoff Status**: COMPLETE
**Workflow Status**: BLOCKED - Awaiting Human Review
**Next Action**: Human approval of Phase 1 requirements

*This handoff ensures continuity when workflow resumes after human review.*
