# AGENT HANDOFF DOCUMENT

## Phase: UI Design Complete
## Date: 2025-09-12
## Feature: Safety Incident Reporting System

## üéØ CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES (MUST IMPLEMENT)

1. **Anonymous Reporting Must Be Fully Protected**: Anonymous reports MUST NOT log user IP, session data, or any identifying information
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Radio button selection clears all contact fields, no session tracking
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Storing any user session data when anonymous is selected

2. **Severity-Based Alert Escalation**: Critical and High consent violations MUST trigger immediate safety team alerts
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Real-time notifications to on-call safety team for severity ‚â• HIGH
   - ‚ùå Wrong: All incidents getting same notification priority

3. **Sensitive Data Encryption**: All description text, involved parties, and witness information MUST be encrypted at rest
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Encrypt before database storage, decrypt only for authorized safety team
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Plain text storage in database

4. **Audit Trail Requirements**: Every view, edit, and status change MUST be logged with timestamp and user
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Complete action history with user ID, timestamp, and action type
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Basic logging without user attribution or action details

5. **Role-Based Access Control**: Only designated safety team members can view incident details
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Safety team role verification before displaying encrypted content
   - ‚ùå Wrong: General admin access to sensitive incident data

## üìç KEY DOCUMENTS TO READ

| Document | Path | Critical Sections |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| Legacy API Analysis | `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/requirements/legacy-api-feature-analysis.md` | Lines 108-176: Safety System analysis |
| UI Design Document | `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/design/safety-system-ui-design.md` | Component specifications and data models |
| UI Designer Lessons | `/docs/lessons-learned/ui-designer-lessons-learned.md` | Design System v7 requirements, Mantine patterns |

## üö® KNOWN PITFALLS

1. **Anonymous vs Identified Data Handling**: Mixing anonymous and identified report storage patterns
   - **Why it happens**: Legacy systems often assume user authentication for all forms
   - **How to avoid**: Create separate data paths for anonymous vs identified submissions

2. **Severity Color Coding Confusion**: Using generic status colors instead of safety-specific severity colors
   - **Why it happens**: Reusing standard success/warning/error colors
   - **How to avoid**: Use exact severity colors from design document (#228B22, #DAA520, #DC143C, #8B0000)

3. **Encryption Implementation Gaps**: Encrypting only some sensitive fields while leaving others plain text
   - **Why it happens**: Unclear understanding of what constitutes sensitive data
   - **How to avoid**: Encrypt ALL user-provided content (description, parties, witnesses, location details)

4. **Mobile Form Usability Issues**: Complex incident reporting form becoming unusable on mobile
   - **Why it happens**: Desktop-first design approach
   - **How to avoid**: Follow mobile wireframes exactly, test touch targets ‚â•44px

## ‚úÖ VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before proceeding to implementation phase, verify:

- [ ] Anonymous reporting path completely separate from identified reporting
- [ ] Severity levels mapped to exact colors and alert escalation rules
- [ ] All sensitive data fields marked for encryption in data model
- [ ] Role-based access control integrated with existing auth system
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior tested for all form components
- [ ] Mantine v7 components selected match design specifications
- [ ] Floating label animations implemented for ALL text inputs
- [ ] Privacy notices prominent and legally compliant

## üîÑ DISCOVERED CONSTRAINTS

1. **Existing Auth System**: Modern API uses cookie-based authentication with role management
   - **Impact**: Must integrate safety team roles with existing user role system
   - **Required Changes**: Extend user roles to include "SafetyTeam" and "SafetyAdmin"

2. **Mantine v7 Framework**: UI must use Mantine components exclusively per ADR-004
   - **Impact**: All designs specified use Mantine component library
   - **Required Changes**: No custom UI components outside Mantine ecosystem

3. **Design System v7**: Strict color palette and animation requirements
   - **Impact**: Cannot deviate from specified colors (#880124, #B76D75, #FFBF00, etc.)
   - **Required Changes**: Use exact hex values, implement signature animations

## üìä DATA MODEL DECISIONS

```
Entity: IncidentReport
- Id: Guid (Required) - Primary key, used in tracking numbers
- ReporterId: Guid? (Optional) - Null for anonymous reports
- Type: IncidentType enum (Required) - safety_violation, consent_violation, etc.
- Severity: IncidentSeverity enum (Required) - low, medium, high, critical
- IncidentDate: DateTime (Required) - When incident occurred
- Location: string (Required, Encrypted) - Where incident occurred
- Description: string (Required, Encrypted) - Detailed incident description
- InvolvedParties: string? (Optional, Encrypted) - Names/descriptions
- Witnesses: string? (Optional, Encrypted) - Witness information
- ReporterEmail: string? (Optional) - Contact if not anonymous
- ReporterPhone: string? (Optional) - Contact if not anonymous
- IsAnonymous: bool (Required) - Privacy flag
- Status: IncidentStatus enum (Required) - New, InProgress, Resolved
- AssignedTo: Guid? (Optional) - Safety team member ID
- CreatedAt: DateTime (Required) - Auto-generated
- UpdatedAt: DateTime (Required) - Auto-updated

Entity: IncidentAuditLog
- Id: Guid (Required) - Primary key
- IncidentId: Guid (Required) - Foreign key to IncidentReport
- UserId: Guid (Required) - Who performed the action
- Action: string (Required) - What action was performed
- Details: string? (Optional) - Additional action context
- Timestamp: DateTime (Required) - When action occurred

Business Logic:
- Reference numbers generated as: {TYPE}-{YYYYMMDD}-{Random4Digits}
- Critical/High severity incidents trigger immediate notifications
- Anonymous reports have NO user session tracking
- All encrypted fields use AES-256 encryption
```

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

1. **Anonymous Submission Test**:
   - **Input**: Submit incident with "Anonymous Report" selected
   - **Expected Output**: No user identification stored, tracking number generated, safety team notified

2. **Critical Incident Alert Test**:
   - **Input**: Submit incident with severity="critical", type="consent_violation"
   - **Expected Output**: Immediate email/SMS to on-call safety team, admin dashboard shows alert

3. **Audit Trail Test**:
   - **Input**: Safety team member views, edits, and updates incident status
   - **Expected Output**: Complete audit log with user, timestamp, and action details

4. **Encryption Verification Test**:
   - **Input**: Submit incident with sensitive description and involved parties
   - **Expected Output**: Database shows encrypted values, UI displays decrypted for safety team only

## ‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT IMPLEMENT

- ‚ùå DO NOT store any session data for anonymous reports
- ‚ùå DO NOT use generic notification patterns - severity requires specific escalation
- ‚ùå DO NOT implement plain text storage for ANY user-provided content
- ‚ùå DO NOT allow general admin access to incident details without safety team role
- ‚ùå DO NOT create custom UI components - use Mantine v7 exclusively
- ‚ùå DO NOT deviate from Design System v7 colors and animations
- ‚ùå DO NOT implement without mobile-first responsive design
- ‚ùå DO NOT skip floating label animations on form inputs
