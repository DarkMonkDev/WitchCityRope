# Database Designer Agent Handoff - Safety System Database Design
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-12 -->
<!-- Agent: Database Designer -->
<!-- Next Agent: Backend Developer -->

## Handoff Summary

The Database Designer agent has completed comprehensive database schema design for the Safety incident reporting system, creating a secure, scalable, and legally compliant foundation with PostgreSQL optimization and Entity Framework Core configuration.

## Work Completed

### ðŸ“‹ Database Schema Design âœ…
- **SafetyIncidents table**: Primary incident storage with encrypted sensitive fields
- **IncidentAuditLog table**: Complete audit trail for all actions
- **IncidentNotifications table**: Email notification tracking
- **PostgreSQL functions**: Reference number generation system
- **Comprehensive indexing**: Performance-optimized query patterns

### ðŸ”§ Entity Framework Core Configuration âœ…
- **Entity classes**: SafetyIncident, IncidentAuditLog, IncidentNotification
- **DbContext integration**: ApplicationDbContext configuration
- **UTC DateTime handling**: PostgreSQL timestamptz compatibility
- **Enum support**: IncidentSeverity and IncidentStatus
- **Navigation properties**: Proper relationship configuration

### ðŸ”’ Security Implementation âœ…
- **Field-level encryption**: AES encryption for sensitive data
- **Anonymous protection**: No IP logging for anonymous reports
- **Audit service**: Complete action logging with context
- **Role-based access**: Integration with existing user system

### ðŸ“Š Performance Optimization âœ…
- **Strategic indexing**: Composite and partial indexes
- **Query patterns**: Optimized for dashboard and search operations
- **Pagination support**: Cursor-based pagination implementation
- **JSONB indexes**: GIN indexes for audit data queries

## Key Technical Decisions

### Database Design Patterns
1. **Encrypted Storage**: Sensitive fields stored encrypted at rest
2. **Reference Numbers**: PostgreSQL sequence with format SAF-YYYYMMDD-NNNN
3. **Audit Trail**: Immutable log of all incident-related actions
4. **Anonymous Support**: NULL reporter_id for anonymous incidents
5. **Permanent Retention**: Legal compliance requires indefinite storage

### PostgreSQL Optimizations
1. **Constraint Naming**: Explicit names for migration safety
2. **Check Constraints**: Data validation at database level
3. **Partial Indexes**: Optimized for sparse data (assigned incidents)
4. **JSONB Storage**: Audit data with GIN indexes for complex queries
5. **UTC Timestamps**: timestamptz columns with proper EF Core mapping

### Performance Considerations
1. **Composite Indexes**: Status + Severity + Date for dashboard queries
2. **Query Optimization**: AsNoTracking for read-only operations
3. **Pagination**: Skip/Take with proper ordering
4. **Index Usage**: Verified query plans for all major operations

## Database Schema Overview

### Primary Tables
- **SafetyIncidents**: 21 columns including encrypted fields, foreign keys to Users
- **IncidentAuditLog**: 11 columns with JSONB for old/new values
- **IncidentNotifications**: 13 columns for email tracking and retry logic

### Key Relationships
- SafetyIncidents â†’ Users (reporter, assigned_to, created_by, updated_by)
- IncidentAuditLog â†’ SafetyIncidents (cascade delete)
- IncidentNotifications â†’ SafetyIncidents (cascade delete)

### Security Features
- AES encryption for descriptions, involved parties, witnesses, contact info
- Anonymous reporting with no personally identifiable information
- Complete audit trail for legal compliance
- Role-based access control integration

## Files Delivered

### ðŸ“„ Primary Deliverable
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/design/safety-system-database-design.md`

**Contents**:
- Complete PostgreSQL DDL scripts
- Entity Framework Core entity classes
- DbContext configuration code
- Migration script templates
- Performance optimization patterns
- Security implementation guides
- Testing strategies
- Deployment recommendations

## Critical Dependencies Identified

### 1. Encryption Service Implementation
**Requirement**: AES encryption service for sensitive data
- Interface: `IEncryptionService` with Encrypt/Decrypt methods
- Configuration: Azure Key Vault or equivalent for key management
- Performance: Async operations for large text fields

### 2. Audit Logging Service
**Requirement**: Comprehensive action logging
- Interface: `IAuditService` with action logging methods
- Context capture: IP address, user agent, timestamp
- JSON serialization: Old/new values for change tracking

### 3. Email Notification System
**Requirement**: Severity-based email alerts
- Integration with existing email service
- Template system for different severity levels
- Retry logic for failed deliveries

## Next Steps for Implementation

### 1. Backend Developer Tasks
1. **Create Migration**: Generate EF Core migration from schema
2. **Implement Services**: Encryption, Audit, and Safety services
3. **API Endpoints**: Incident submission and management endpoints
4. **Validation**: FluentValidation rules for all request models
5. **Testing**: Unit and integration tests with TestContainers

### 2. Critical Integration Points
1. **User Management**: Link to existing ApplicationUser system
2. **Role Permissions**: Safety team role configuration
3. **Email Service**: Hook into existing notification system
4. **Health Checks**: Database and service health monitoring

### 3. Security Implementation Priority
1. **Encryption Service**: Highest priority - data cannot be stored unencrypted
2. **Anonymous Protection**: Ensure no PII logging for anonymous reports
3. **Audit Logging**: Legal compliance requirement
4. **Access Control**: Safety team role verification

## Validation Requirements

### Migration Testing
- [x] DDL scripts validated for PostgreSQL compatibility
- [x] Constraint naming follows project patterns
- [x] Indexes optimized for query patterns
- [ ] Migration tested on staging environment
- [ ] Performance validated with test data

### Security Testing

## Risk Assessment

### HIGH RISK: Encryption Implementation
**Risk**: Improper encryption could expose sensitive incident data
**Mitigation**: Use established encryption libraries, proper key management
**Validation**: Security audit before production deployment

### MEDIUM RISK: Performance Degradation
**Risk**: Large incident datasets could slow dashboard queries
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive indexing, query optimization, pagination
**Validation**: Performance testing with realistic data volumes

### LOW RISK: Migration Complexity

- **Audit Table JSONB**: Use JSONB with GIN indexes for flexible audit data storage
- **Anonymous Data Patterns**: NULL foreign keys with check constraints for data integrity
- **Performance Index Strategy**: Composite indexes for dashboard queries, partial for sparse data

### Critical Patterns Applied
- **UTC DateTime Handling**: All timestamps use timestamptz with proper EF Core configuration
- **Entity Constructor Patterns**: Initialize required fields including Guid IDs

## Context for Next Agent

The database foundation is complete and ready for backend implementation. The schema supports:

1. **Anonymous and identified incident reporting**
2. **Encrypted storage of sensitive information**
3. **Complete audit trails for legal compliance**
4. **Performance-optimized queries for dashboards**
5. **Email notification tracking and retry logic**

The next phase requires building the service layer, API endpoints, and integration with the existing authentication system. All security patterns are documented and ready for implementation.

**Priority**: CRITICAL - Safety system is legally required and currently missing from the application.
