# API Cleanup Legacy Feature Extraction - Progress
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-12 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Orchestrator Agent -->
<!-- Status: Active -->

## Overview
Tracking progress for critical architectural cleanup to resolve duplicate API projects crisis and extract valuable features from legacy API.

## Context Summary
**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE**: Two separate API projects exist simultaneously:
1. **Modern API** at `/apps/api/` (port 5655) - ACTIVE and serving React frontend
2. **Legacy API** at `/src/WitchCityRope.Api/` - DORMANT but contains valuable features

**Root Cause**: During React migration in August 2025, new simplified API was created instead of refactoring existing API, leaving legacy API in place.

## Human Review Points

### MANDATORY Review #1: After Requirements Phase
**Trigger**: Requirements analysis completion
**Required Approval**: Feature extraction priority and scope
**Blocks**: All Phase 2 work until approval

### MANDATORY Review #2: After First Vertical Slice
**Trigger**: First feature successfully extracted
**Required Approval**: Technical approach validation
**Blocks**: Full rollout until approval

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
- [ ] Complete inventory of legacy API features
- [ ] All valuable features extracted to modern API
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to existing React frontend
- [ ] Legacy API safely archived
- [ ] Updated documentation reflects single API architecture

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] 100% feature parity for extracted components
- [ ] Response times maintain <200ms performance
- [ ] All tests passing after extraction
- [ ] Zero deployment issues
- [ ] Clean git history with proper archival

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Data Loss Risk**: Incomplete feature extraction
2. **Breaking Changes**: Frontend integration issues
3. **Performance Degradation**: Poor extraction implementation
4. **Legacy Dependencies**: Hidden coupling discovery

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Auditing**: Complete feature inventory before extraction
2. **Incremental Approach**: Extract one feature at a time
3. **Extensive Testing**: Full test coverage for each extraction
4. **Rollback Planning**: Safe reversion procedures

## Emergency Procedures

### If Critical Issues Discovered
1. **STOP ALL WORK** immediately
2. Document issue in `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/reviews/emergency-stop-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Notify via escalation procedures
4. Wait for explicit approval to continue

### If Legacy API Still Required
1. Reassess extraction strategy
2. Consider gradual deprecation approach
3. Update requirements based on findings
4. Get human approval for scope changes

## Progress Summary

**Started**: 2025-09-12
