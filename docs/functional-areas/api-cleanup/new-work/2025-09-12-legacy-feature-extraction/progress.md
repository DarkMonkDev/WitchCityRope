# API Cleanup Legacy Feature Extraction - Progress
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-12 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Orchestrator Agent -->
<!-- Status: Active -->

## Overview
Tracking progress for critical architectural cleanup to resolve duplicate API projects crisis and extract valuable features from legacy API.

## Context Summary
**CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL ISSUE**: Two separate API projects exist simultaneously:
1. **Modern API** at `/apps/api/` (port 5655) - ACTIVE and serving React frontend
2. **Legacy API** at `/src/WitchCityRope.Api/` - DORMANT but contains valuable features

**Root Cause**: During React migration in August 2025, new simplified API was created instead of refactoring existing API, leaving legacy API in place.

## Workflow Status Template

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
**Quality Gate**: Requirements completeness ✅ 100% ACHIEVED
**Status**: COMPLETE - AWAITING MANDATORY HUMAN REVIEW

| Task | Status | Agent | Completion Date | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Legacy API feature audit | ✅ COMPLETE | Backend Developer | 2025-09-12 | 7 feature systems analyzed |
| Feature value assessment | ✅ COMPLETE | Backend Developer | 2025-09-12 | Priority matrix created |
| Business requirements doc | ✅ COMPLETE | Backend Developer | 2025-09-12 | Critical: Safety system missing |
| Requirements review | 🔴 BLOCKED | Human | REQUIRED | **MANDATORY - CANNOT PROCEED** |

### Phase 2: Design & Planning
**Quality Gate**: Design completeness 10% → 90%
**REQUIRES**: Phase 1 human approval ✅ RECEIVED
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - UI Design Phase

| Task | Status | Agent | Completion Date | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| UI design updates | 🔄 IN PROGRESS | UI Designer | 2025-09-12 | Safety System UI - MANDATORY FIRST |
| Functional specification | ⏳ PENDING | Business Requirements | TBD | After UI approval |
| Technical design | ⏳ PENDING | Backend Developer | TBD | Migration strategy |
| Database impact analysis | ⏳ PENDING | Database Designer | TBD | Schema changes needed |
| Test strategy | ⏳ PENDING | Test Developer | TBD | Testing approach |

### Phase 3: Implementation
**Quality Gate**: Implementation completeness 0% → 85%
**REQUIRES**: Phase 2 completion

| Task | Status | Agent | Completion Date | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Feature extraction | ⏳ PENDING | Backend Developer | TBD | Extract from legacy API |
| Modern API integration | ⏳ PENDING | Backend Developer | TBD | Add to /apps/api/ |
| Frontend integration | ⏳ PENDING | React Developer | TBD | Connect React to new features |
| Database migrations | ⏳ PENDING | Database Designer | TBD | Schema updates |

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
**Quality Gate**: Testing completeness 0% → 100%

| Task | Status | Agent | Completion Date | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Unit tests | ⏳ PENDING | Test Developer | TBD | Feature-level testing |
| Integration tests | ⏳ PENDING | Test Developer | TBD | API endpoint testing |
| E2E tests | ⏳ PENDING | Test Executor | TBD | Full user flow testing |
| Performance validation | ⏳ PENDING | Test Executor | TBD | Response time verification |

### Phase 5: Finalization & Cleanup
**Quality Gate**: Final cleanup and documentation

| Task | Status | Agent | Completion Date | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| Legacy API archival | ⏳ PENDING | Git Manager | TBD | Safe removal process |
| Documentation updates | ⏳ PENDING | Librarian | TBD | Update all references |
| Deployment validation | ⏳ PENDING | DevOps | TBD | Production readiness |
| Project completion | ⏳ PENDING | Orchestrator | TBD | Final success verification |

## Human Review Points

### MANDATORY Review #1: After Requirements Phase
**Trigger**: Requirements analysis completion
**Required Approval**: Feature extraction priority and scope
**Blocks**: All Phase 2 work until approval

### MANDATORY Review #2: After First Vertical Slice
**Trigger**: First feature successfully extracted
**Required Approval**: Technical approach validation
**Blocks**: Full rollout until approval

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
- [ ] Complete inventory of legacy API features
- [ ] All valuable features extracted to modern API
- [ ] Zero breaking changes to existing React frontend
- [ ] Legacy API safely archived
- [ ] Updated documentation reflects single API architecture

### Quality Metrics
- [ ] 100% feature parity for extracted components
- [ ] Response times maintain <200ms performance
- [ ] All tests passing after extraction
- [ ] Zero deployment issues
- [ ] Clean git history with proper archival

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Items
1. **Data Loss Risk**: Incomplete feature extraction
2. **Breaking Changes**: Frontend integration issues
3. **Performance Degradation**: Poor extraction implementation
4. **Legacy Dependencies**: Hidden coupling discovery

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Comprehensive Auditing**: Complete feature inventory before extraction
2. **Incremental Approach**: Extract one feature at a time
3. **Extensive Testing**: Full test coverage for each extraction
4. **Rollback Planning**: Safe reversion procedures

## Emergency Procedures

### If Critical Issues Discovered
1. **STOP ALL WORK** immediately
2. Document issue in `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-12-legacy-feature-extraction/reviews/emergency-stop-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
3. Notify via escalation procedures
4. Wait for explicit approval to continue

### If Legacy API Still Required
1. Reassess extraction strategy
2. Consider gradual deprecation approach
3. Update requirements based on findings
4. Get human approval for scope changes

## Progress Summary

**Started**: 2025-09-12
