# CheckIn System Implementation Kickoff

<!-- Created: 2025-09-13 -->
<!-- Status: STARTING -->
<!-- Priority: HIGH -->

## Overview

Starting implementation of the **CheckIn System** - the second HIGH priority feature identified in our legacy API analysis.

## Feature Summary from Legacy Analysis

The CheckIn System provides:
- **Multi-modal check-in**: QR codes, manual entry, staff validation
- **Real-time tracking**: Live attendance updates
- **Comprehensive data**: Attendee details, emergency contacts, dietary needs
- **History tracking**: Check-in times and patterns
- **Staff tools**: Quick search and validation

## Implementation Approach

Following the successful Safety System pattern:
1. **Simplified Design**: Focus on core check-in functionality
2. **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Consistent with modern API
3. **Mobile-First UI**: Event staff use phones/tablets
4. **Performance Focus**: Quick check-ins critical for events

## Key Simplifications to Consider

Based on Safety System learnings:
- Start with manual check-in (QR codes can be added later)
- Simple attendee list rather than complex ticketing
- Basic check-in/out rather than multi-session tracking
- Email confirmations only (no SMS)

## Timeline Estimate

- **Day 1**: Design (UI, Database, Technical)
- **Day 2**: Backend Implementation
- **Day 3**: Frontend Implementation
- **Day 4**: Testing & Polish

## Next Steps

1. UI Design for check-in interface
2. Functional specification
3. Database schema design
4. Technical architecture

Starting with UI design per workflow requirements.
