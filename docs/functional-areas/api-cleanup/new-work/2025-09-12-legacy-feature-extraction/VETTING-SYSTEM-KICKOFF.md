# Vetting System Implementation Kickoff

<!-- Created: 2025-09-13 -->
<!-- Status: STARTING -->
<!-- Priority: HIGH -->

## Overview

Starting implementation of the **Vetting System** - the third HIGH priority feature for member approval and community access control.

## Feature Summary from Legacy Analysis

The Vetting System provides:
- **Member application workflow**: Multi-stage approval process
- **Reference verification**: External reference checking
- **Scoring system**: Objective evaluation criteria
- **Role progression**: From applicant to vetted member
- **Audit trail**: Complete history of vetting decisions

## Implementation Approach

Following the successful patterns from Safety and CheckIn systems:
1. **Simplified workflow**: Start with basic approve/deny
2. **Vertical slice architecture**: Consistent with modern API
3. **Mobile-friendly**: Review on any device
4. **Privacy-focused**: Protect applicant information

## Key Simplifications to Consider

Based on previous successes:
- Basic approval workflow (no complex scoring initially)
- Simple reference collection (name + contact)
- Email notifications only
- Two-stage process: Application → Review → Decision
- Manual review only (no automation initially)

## Community-Specific Requirements

For the rope bondage community:
- **Safety first**: Vetting ensures community safety
- **Privacy protection**: Sensitive information handling
- **Consent verification**: Understanding of community rules
- **Experience assessment**: Prior experience helpful but not required
- **Reference quality**: Community references preferred

## Timeline Estimate

- **Day 1**: Design (UI, Database, Technical)
- **Day 2-3**: Backend Implementation
- **Day 3-4**: Frontend Implementation
- **Day 4**: Testing & Polish

## Next Steps

1. UI Design for vetting workflow
2. Functional specification
3. Database schema design
4. Technical architecture

Starting with UI design per workflow requirements.
