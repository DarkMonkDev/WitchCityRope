# Phase 1 Requirements Review - API Cleanup Feature Extraction

<!-- Created: 2025-09-12 -->
<!-- Status: AWAITING HUMAN APPROVAL -->
<!-- Owner: Orchestrator -->
<!-- Review Type: MANDATORY - WORKFLOW BLOCKING -->

## ðŸ›‘ MANDATORY HUMAN REVIEW CHECKPOINT

**This review is REQUIRED before proceeding to Phase 2. No further work can continue until explicit approval is received.**

## Executive Summary

Phase 1 Requirements Analysis is **COMPLETE**. We have identified **7 major feature systems** in the legacy API with a **CRITICAL FINDING**: The Safety incident reporting system is completely missing from the modern API, creating a **legal compliance risk**.

## Critical Findings

### ðŸš¨ HIGHEST PRIORITY - Legal Compliance Risk
**Safety System** is completely absent from modern API:
- Anonymous incident reporting capability
- Severity-based alerting to administrators
- Encrypted data handling for sensitive reports
- Audit trail for legal compliance

**Risk**: Without this system, the community lacks proper incident documentation which could expose legal liability.

## Feature Analysis Summary

### Features to EXTRACT (Business-Critical)

| Feature | Priority | Complexity | Timeline | Justification |
|---------|----------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **Safety System** | CRITICAL | High | Week 1 | Legal compliance, member safety |
| **CheckIn System** | HIGH | Medium | Week 2 | Core event functionality |
| **Vetting System** | HIGH | High | Week 3 | Community access control |
| **Events Enhancement** | MEDIUM | Low | Week 2 | Session/ticket management |
| **Dashboard** | MEDIUM | Low | Week 3 | User experience |
| **Enhanced Payments** | MEDIUM | Medium | Week 4 | Automation & reconciliation |

### Features to ARCHIVE (Not Currently Needed)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Legacy Auth 2FA | Modern API uses different auth pattern |
| Email Templates | Can be recreated when needed |
| Audit Logs | Basic version exists in modern API |

### Key Technical Decisions

1. **Authentication Architecture**
   - Confirmed: Cookie-based for users (NOT JWT)
   - JWT only for service-to-service
   - Modern API pattern will be maintained

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - TestContainers for all database tests
   - No in-memory database testing
   - Light performance testing only (small user base)

3. **Migration Approach**
   - Vertical slice architecture in modern API
   - Incremental commits for easy rollback
   - Feature-by-feature extraction

## Proposed Implementation Timeline

### Week 1: Critical Safety System
- Extract and implement Safety feature
- Legal compliance achieved
- Full testing and validation

### Week 2: Core Event Features
- CheckIn system extraction
- Events enhancement (sessions, tickets)
- Frontend integration

### Week 3: Community Management
- Vetting system implementation
- Dashboard features
- Member experience improvements

### Week 4: Financial & Cleanup
- Enhanced payment features
- Legacy API archival
- Documentation finalization

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Safety system delay | HIGH - Legal exposure | Prioritized for Week 1 |
| Data migration errors | MEDIUM - Data loss | Incremental commits, backups |
| Frontend breaking | MEDIUM - User impact | Comprehensive testing |
| Performance degradation | LOW - User experience | Monitoring, optimization |

## Required Approvals

### âœ… Please confirm the following:

- [ ] **Priority Order**: Safety â†’ CheckIn â†’ Vetting â†’ Others
- [ ] **4-Week Timeline**: Acceptable for full implementation
- [ ] **Safety System**: Approved as CRITICAL priority
- [ ] **Archive Strategy**: Agree to archive non-critical features
- [ ] **Testing Approach**: TestContainers and light performance testing
- [ ] **Migration Pattern**: Vertical slice architecture

### ðŸ”´ Specific Questions Requiring Answers:

1. **Safety System Features**: Do you need ALL safety features or just core incident reporting?
2. **CheckIn Requirements**: Is QR code functionality essential or can we start with manual check-in?
3. **Vetting Complexity**: Can we simplify the multi-stage vetting to a basic approval workflow initially?
4. **Payment Priority**: Should payment enhancements wait until after core features?

## Next Steps (Upon Approval)

1. **Phase 2 Design**: UI mockups for new features
2. **Technical Specification**: Detailed implementation plans
3. **Database Design**: Schema updates for new features
4. **Test Planning**: Comprehensive test strategy
