**‚úÖ PostgreSQL-Specific Features**:
- timestamptz for all DateTime fields (UTC handling)
- JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- INET type for IP address tracking
- Generated UUID primary keys for distribution

## üöÄ Implementation Guidelines

### Entity Framework Core Integration
**Critical Requirements for Backend Developer**:

1. **UTC DateTime Handling**: 
   ```csharp
   // MANDATORY: All DateTime properties must use timestamptz
   entity.Property(e => e.CreatedAt)
         .IsRequired()
         .HasColumnType("timestamptz");
   ```

2. **Money Value Object Pattern**:
   ```csharp
   // Use separate properties to avoid nullable owned entity issues
   builder.Property(p => p.AmountValue)
          .HasColumnType("decimal(10,2)")
          .HasColumnName("AmountValue");
   ```

3. **Enum Configurations**:
   ```csharp
   // Configure enums as integers for PostgreSQL compatibility
   builder.Property(p => p.Status)
          .HasConversion<int>();
   ```

4. **JSONB Configuration**:
   ```csharp
   // Essential for metadata flexibility
   builder.Property(p => p.Metadata)
          .HasColumnType("jsonb")
          .HasDefaultValue("{}");
   ```

### Migration Implementation Strategy
**Phase 1: Core Schema** (Immediate):
- Create all payment tables with relationships
- Apply all business rule constraints
- Create performance indexes
- Test with sample data

**Phase 2: Data Migration** (If needed):
- Migrate any existing payment data from legacy systems
- Validate data integrity post-migration
- Update foreign key relationships
- Test payment workflows with real data

**Phase 3: Performance Optimization** (Post-deployment):
- Monitor query performance with real workloads
- Add additional indexes based on usage patterns
- Implement Row Level Security if multi-tenancy needed
- Configure connection pooling optimization

## üîç Key Business Rules Enforced

### Sliding Scale Pricing Rules
**‚úÖ Community Values Preserved**:
- 0-75% discount range enforced via CHECK constraints
- No verification required (honor system implementation)
- Sliding scale percentage tracked for analytics
- Privacy-preserved discount usage (no public exposure)

### Payment Processing Rules
**‚úÖ Financial Security**:
- Amount validation (positive values only)
- Currency consistency between payments and refunds
- Refund amount cannot exceed original payment
- Single completed payment per event registration

### Refund Policy Implementation
**‚úÖ Business Logic Enforcement**:
- Only completed payments eligible for refunds
- Complete refund reason documentation required (minimum 10 characters)
- Administrative approval tracking (processed by user)
- Partial refund support with amount validation

## üìä Analytics & Reporting Support

### Built-in Analytics Capabilities
**‚úÖ Business Intelligence Queries**:
- Revenue tracking by sliding scale usage
- Payment success rate monitoring
- Refund pattern analysis
- User payment behavior tracking

**‚úÖ Performance Monitoring**:
- Payment processing time analysis
- Failed payment trend tracking
- User experience metrics (conversion rates)
- System health monitoring queries

**‚úÖ Community Impact Measurement**:
- Sliding scale adoption rates
- Economic accessibility impact
- Event participation correlation
- Financial sustainability tracking

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Implementation Notes

2. **UTC Conversion**: Ensure all DateTime values converted to UTC before database save
3. **Business Rule Validation**: Implement domain service validation before database operations
4. **Audit Logging**: Ensure all payment operations trigger audit log entries
5. **Connection Pooling**: Configure appropriate connection pool settings for payment load

### Database Performance Considerations
1. **Query Optimization**: Use provided indexes for common payment queries
2. **Connection Management**: Implement proper connection lifecycle for payment processing
3. **Transaction Management**: Use database transactions for payment/refund operations
4. **Monitoring**: Implement query performance monitoring for payment operations
5. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure payment data included in backup/recovery procedures
