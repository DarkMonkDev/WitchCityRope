# Payment System Design Phase Handoff
**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Phase**: Design Complete
**Feature**: Payment System with Sliding Scale Pricing
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Executive Summary

The Payment System design phase is complete with comprehensive documentation covering business requirements, UI design, database schema, and technical architecture. The system emphasizes WitchCityRope's core value of economic inclusivity through honor-based sliding scale pricing (0-75% discount).

## Completed Design Deliverables

### 1. Business Requirements ✅
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-13-payment-extraction/requirements/payment-system-business-requirements.md`
- Complete user stories with acceptance criteria
- Sliding scale pricing requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE business value)
- Security and PCI compliance requirements
- MVP scope clearly defined (1-2 week implementation)

### 2. UI Design ✅
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-13-payment-extraction/design/payment-system-ui-design.md`
- Dignified sliding scale interface design
- Mobile-responsive payment flows
- Admin payment management interfaces
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Design System v7 integration with exact colors and animations

### 3. Database Schema ✅
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-13-payment-extraction/design/payment-system-database-design.md`
- 6 core entities: Payment, PaymentMethod, Refund, PaymentAuditLog, PaymentFailures, PaymentWebhooks
- PCI-compliant design (no card storage)
- PostgreSQL-optimized with strategic indexing
- Complete Entity Framework Core configurations
- Money value object pattern implementation

### 4. Technical Architecture ✅
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/api-cleanup/new-work/2025-09-13-payment-extraction/design/payment-system-technical-architecture.md`
- Vertical Slice Architecture pattern
- Stripe integration flows
- Service layer design (PaymentService, StripeService, RefundService)
- RESTful API endpoints
- Security and error handling strategies

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Sliding Scale Pricing
- **Honor-based system**: No verification required
- **0-75% discount range**: Community-determined limits
- **Privacy protected**: Usage is confidential
- **Dignified presentation**: Mutual support, not charity

### 2. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: .NET 9 Minimal API with Vertical Slice Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Mantine v7
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core 9
- **Payment Provider**: Stripe (PCI compliance)
- **Security**: AES-256 encryption for sensitive data

### 3. MVP Scope (Week 1-2)
- Event registration payment processing
- Sliding scale discount application
- Basic Stripe integration
- Payment confirmation and receipts
- Registration status updates

### 4. Future Enhancements (Phase 2)
- Saved payment methods
- Comprehensive refund processing
- Payment history and reporting
- Multiple payment providers
- Recurring payments

## Implementation Ready Checklist

✅ **Requirements**
- Business rules documented
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Security requirements defined
- Success metrics established

✅ **Design**
- UI wireframes and component specs
- Database schema with migrations
- API endpoint specifications
- Integration flow diagrams

✅ **Architecture**
- Service layer design complete
- Error handling strategy defined
- Performance optimization planned
- Testing approach documented

✅ **Standards Compliance**
- Follows Vertical Slice Architecture
- Uses established WitchCityRope patterns
- Cookie-based authentication
- Result pattern for error handling

## Implementation Order (Recommended)

### Week 1: Backend Implementation
1. **Day 1-2**: Database entities and migrations
2. **Day 3-4**: Core payment services and Stripe integration
3. **Day 5**: API endpoints and validation

### Week 2: Frontend & Integration
1. **Day 1-2**: React components and payment flow
2. **Day 3**: Sliding scale interface
3. **Day 4**: Testing and error handling
4. **Day 5**: Integration testing and deployment

## Critical Implementation Notes

### 1. Stripe Configuration Required
- Stripe account setup with API keys
- Webhook endpoint configuration
- Test mode for development
- Production keys for deployment

### 2. Environment Variables Needed
```
STRIPE_API_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
ENCRYPTION_KEY=[existing from Safety system]
```

### 3. Database Migration
```bash
dotnet ef migrations add AddPaymentSystem --project apps/api
dotnet ef database update --project apps/api
```

### 4. Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for payment calculations
- Integration tests with Stripe test mode
- E2E tests for complete payment flow
- Security testing for PCI compliance

## Risk Mitigation

1. **PCI Compliance**: Using Stripe's token-based approach eliminates card storage risk
2. **Financial Accuracy**: Money value object ensures precision
3. **Sliding Scale Abuse**: Honor system with audit trails
4. **Payment Failures**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Sliding scale pricing working (0-75% discount)
- ✅ Stripe payments processing successfully
- ✅ Registration status updating on payment
- ✅ Email receipts sending
- ✅ < 2 second payment processing time
- ✅ 99%+ payment success rate
- ✅ Zero security incidents
