# Payment System Analysis - Legacy to Modern API Extraction

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Analyst**: Backend Developer Agent  
**Objective**: Analyze legacy Payment system to guide modern API implementation

## Executive Summary

The legacy WitchCityRope system contains a comprehensive payment processing system that needs to be extracted and modernized. The modern API currently has **ZERO payment functionality**, making this a complete greenfield implementation. 

The legacy system supports:
- Sliding scale pricing (critical business requirement)  
- Stripe payment processing with full workflow
- Comprehensive refund handling with business rules
- Multiple payment methods (Credit Card, PayPal, Venmo, Cash)
- Rich domain modeling with strong business rule enforcement

## 1. Feature Inventory

### 1.1 Core Payment Features

#### Payment Processing
```csharp
// From ProcessPaymentCommand.cs - Full Stripe integration
public enum PaymentType
{
    EventRegistration,     // Primary use case
    MembershipFee,        // Recurring payments  
    Merchandise,          // Online store
    Donation,            // Community support
    Other                // Flexible category
}

public enum PaymentMethod
{
    SavedCard,           // Stored payment methods
    NewCard,            // One-time cards  
    BankTransfer,       // Direct bank transfer
    PayPal,             // PayPal integration
    Venmo              // Popular peer-to-peer payments
}
```

#### Payment States & Lifecycle
```csharp
// From PaymentStatus.cs - Comprehensive status tracking
public enum PaymentStatus
{
    NotRequired,         // Free events, RSVP only
    Pending,            // Payment initiated but not processed
    Completed,          // Payment successfully completed  
    Failed,             // Payment failed or declined
    Refunded,           // Payment was refunded
    PartiallyRefunded   // Partial refund issued
}
```

### 1.2 Business Rules Implementation

#### Sliding Scale Pricing (CRITICAL)
- Honor-system based pricing allowing users to pay what they can afford
- Supports 0-75% discount based on financial circumstances
- Core community value ensuring accessibility

#### Refund Processing
```csharp
// From Payment.cs - Rich refund business logic
public void InitiateRefund(Money? refundAmount = null, string? reason = null)
{
    if (Status != PaymentStatus.Completed)
        throw new DomainException("Only completed payments can be refunded");
        
    if (RefundedAt.HasValue)
        throw new DomainException("Payment has already been refunded");
        
    RefundAmount = refundAmount ?? Amount;
    
    if (RefundAmount.Amount > Amount.Amount)
        throw new DomainException("Refund amount cannot exceed original payment amount");
}
```

#### Payment-Registration Relationship
- 1:1 relationship between Payment and Registration
- Payment required for registration confirmation
- Automatic registration status updates on payment success

### 1.3 External Integrations

#### Stripe Integration
```csharp
// From ProcessPaymentCommandHandler - Full Stripe workflow
- Customer creation and management
- Payment method storage and reuse  
- Idempotent payment processing
- Webhook handling for async updates
- Receipt generation and email delivery
- Processing fee tracking
- Metadata support for order tracking
```

#### Email Integration
- Payment receipt emails
- Refund confirmation emails  
- Failed payment notifications

### 1.4 Data Models

#### Core Payment Entity
```csharp
public class Payment
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; }
    public Guid RegistrationId { get; private set; }
    public Registration Registration { get; private set; }
    public Money Amount { get; private set; }           // Sliding scale amount
    public PaymentStatus Status { get; private set; }
    public string PaymentMethod { get; private set; }
    public string TransactionId { get; private set; }   // Stripe transaction ID
    public DateTime ProcessedAt { get; private set; }
    public DateTime UpdatedAt { get; private set; }
    
    // Refund support
    public Money RefundAmount { get; private set; }
    public DateTime? RefundedAt { get; private set; }
    public string RefundTransactionId { get; private set; }
    public string RefundReason { get; private set; }
}
```

#### Money Value Object (Rich Domain Model)
```csharp
// From Money.cs - Currency-safe monetary operations
public class Money : IEquatable<Money>, IComparable<Money>
{
    public decimal Amount { get; }
    public string Currency { get; }
    
    // Business rule enforcement
    public static Money Create(decimal amount, string currency = "USD")
    {
        if (amount < 0)
            throw new DomainException("Money amount cannot be negative");
        // ... currency validation
    }
    
    // Safe monetary operations  
    public Money Add(Money other) { /* currency validation */ }
    public Money Subtract(Money other) { /* insufficient funds check */ }
    public Money Multiply(decimal factor) { /* factor validation */ }
}
```
