<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-13 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary

The Payment system extraction represents a critical component of the API modernization effort, requiring the complete implementation of payment processing capabilities in the modern API. The legacy system contains a comprehensive payment platform that supports the community's core values of accessibility through sliding scale pricing while maintaining secure financial transaction processing.

The modern API currently has **ZERO payment functionality**, making this a complete greenfield implementation that must preserve the community's values around economic inclusivity while implementing modern security and performance standards.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
WitchCityRope community members need to pay for event registrations, memberships, and merchandise through a secure, accessible payment system that honors the community's commitment to economic inclusivity. The legacy payment system contains valuable features that must be preserved and enhanced in the modern implementation.

### Business Value
- **Economic Accessibility**: Sliding scale pricing ensures no community member is excluded due to financial constraints
- **Revenue Security**: Secure payment processing protects community income and member financial data
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automated payment workflows reduce administrative overhead
- **Community Growth**: Simplified payment experience encourages event participation and membership

### Success Metrics
- **Payment Success Rate**: >99% payment completion rate for all transaction types
- **Economic Inclusivity**: 100% preservation of sliding scale pricing functionality
- **Processing Speed**: <2 seconds average payment processing time
- **Security Compliance**: Zero payment data security incidents
- **User Satisfaction**: >90% satisfaction with payment experience
- **Administrative Efficiency**: 50% reduction in payment-related support requests
