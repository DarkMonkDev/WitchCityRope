# Business Requirements: React Router v7 Technical Validation
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-19 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary
We need to validate React Router v7 routing and navigation patterns before full feature development begins. This technical validation project will establish proven routing patterns, performance benchmarks, and security implementations that all future WitchCityRope features will depend on.

## Business Context
### Problem Statement
WitchCityRope's migration to React requires a robust routing system that supports our complex user access patterns, role-based route protection, and performance requirements. Without proven routing patterns, all feature development is at risk of rework, security vulnerabilities, and poor user experience.

### Business Value
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify routing blockers before full feature development
- **Development Velocity**: Establish reusable patterns for all teams
- **Security Assurance**: Validate access control at the routing level
- **Performance Guarantee**: Ensure <100ms route transitions meet user expectations
- **Team Confidence**: Prove technical approach before major investment

### Success Metrics
- All 8 routing patterns validated with working code
- Route transitions consistently <100ms
- Protected routes properly enforce access control
- Deep linking works for all user roles
- Zero white-screen errors during navigation
- Team confidence in routing approach >90%

## User Stories

### Story 1: Public Route Access
**As a** Guest visitor
**I want to** navigate to public pages (home, about, events)
**So that** I can learn about WitchCityRope without creating an account

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am an unauthenticated user
- When I navigate to public routes
- Then I can access content immediately
- And navigation is smooth and fast (<100ms)
- And the URL in the browser matches the page content

### Story 2: Protected Route Security
**As a** General Member
**I want to** be redirected to login when accessing protected content
**So that** my session security is maintained

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am not authenticated
- When I attempt to access a protected route (e.g., /dashboard)
- Then I am redirected to /login
- And after successful login, I am returned to my original destination
- And the redirect preserves any query parameters

### Story 3: Role-Based Route Access
**As an** Admin
**I want to** access admin-only routes (/admin/users, /admin/reports)
**So that** I can manage the platform

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am authenticated as an Admin
- When I navigate to admin routes
- Then I can access the content
- And non-admin users receive a 403 error page
- And the route protection is enforced at the routing level

### Story 4: Deep Linking Support
**As a** Vetted Member
**I want to** share and bookmark specific event pages
**So that** I can quickly return to or share relevant content

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I have a direct link to /events/rope-basics-101
- When I paste it in my browser or click from external source
- Then the page loads correctly with all data
- And authentication redirects work properly if needed
- And the page is fully functional after direct access

### Story 5: Nested Route Navigation
**As a** Teacher
**I want to** navigate between event management sub-pages
**So that** I can efficiently manage my workshops

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am on /events/my-workshop-123/edit
- When I click to view attendees
- Then I navigate to /events/my-workshop-123/attendees
- And the parent event context is maintained
- And breadcrumbs show the current location

### Story 6: Query Parameter Management
**As a** Member
**I want to** filter events and maintain those filters in the URL
**So that** I can bookmark and share filtered views

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am viewing events with filters applied
- When I set category=beginner&date=2025-08-20
- Then the URL shows /events?category=beginner&date=2025-08-20
- And refreshing the page maintains the filters
- And the back button properly restores previous filter states

### Story 7: Loading States During Navigation
**As a** Member
**I want to** see loading indicators during route changes
**So that** I understand the system is responding

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I click a link to a data-heavy page
- When the route begins loading
- Then I see a loading indicator
- And the previous page content doesn't disappear abruptly
- And if loading takes >500ms, I see a progress indicator

### Story 8: Error Route Handling
**As a** User
**I want to** see helpful error pages for invalid routes
**So that** I can navigate back to working content

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I navigate to a non-existent route
- When the 404 error occurs
- Then I see a branded WitchCityRope error page
- And I have clear options to return to valid content
- And the error is logged for admin review

## Business Rules

### 1. Route Protection Hierarchy
**Rule**: Access control must be enforced at the routing level before component rendering
**Explanation**: Security cannot depend on component-level checks; routes must validate permissions before loading any protected content.

### 2. Authentication State Persistence
**Rule**: Authentication state must persist across browser refreshes and tab navigation
**Explanation**: Users should not lose their login state when navigating within the platform.

### 3. Role-Based Route Access
**Rule**: Route access must match the platform's user role hierarchy (Guest < General Member < Vetted Member < Teacher < Admin)
**Explanation**: Each route must enforce the minimum required role for access.

### 4. Performance Standards
**Rule**: Route transitions must complete within 100ms for cached routes, 300ms for new data
**Explanation**: User experience depends on responsive navigation; slow route changes feel broken.

### 5. URL Structure Consistency
**Rule**: URLs must be human-readable and follow RESTful patterns
**Explanation**: Clean URLs support SEO, bookmarking, and user understanding.

### 6. Deep Linking Support
**Rule**: All routes must support direct access via URL
**Explanation**: Users should be able to bookmark and share any accessible page.

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must use React Router v7 (latest version for future compatibility)
- Must integrate with existing hybrid JWT + HttpOnly Cookie authentication
- Must support code splitting and lazy loading for performance
- Must work with existing .NET API route structure

### Performance Constraints
- Route transitions: <100ms for cached content
- Initial route load: <300ms for new data
- Bundle size: Each route chunk <50KB gzipped
- Memory usage: No route-related memory leaks

### Security Constraints
- No client-side route bypassing of server permissions
- All protected routes must validate authentication server-side
- Role-based access must be enforced at both route and API levels
- Session timeout must properly redirect to login

### Assumptions
- React Router v7 is stable and production-ready
- Existing authentication API endpoints work correctly
- User roles are properly stored and validated server-side
- Network latency is reasonable for route data fetching

## Security & Privacy Requirements

### Authentication Integration
- Route guards must validate authentication status before rendering
- Expired sessions must redirect to login with return URL
- Multi-tab authentication sync must work across route changes
- Remember me functionality must persist across browser sessions

### Authorization Enforcement
- Each protected route must verify user permissions server-side
- Role-based access control must be enforced before component loading
- Administrative routes must have additional security validation
- Guest access must be properly limited to public routes

### Data Protection
- Route parameters must not expose sensitive information
- Query parameters must be sanitized and validated
- Navigation history must not leak protected information
- Route state must not persist sensitive data in browser storage

## React Router v7 Technical Validation

### Why React Router v7
- **Latest Features**: Access to newest routing capabilities and performance improvements
- **Future Compatibility**: Ensures long-term support and upgrade path
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety for routes and parameters
- **Code Splitting**: Built-in support for lazy loading and bundle optimization
- **Server-Side Rendering**: Future SSR capability if needed

### Critical Patterns to Validate

#### 1. Protected Route Implementation
```typescript
// Validate this pattern works with our auth system
<Route
  path="/dashboard"
  element={<ProtectedRoute requiredRole="Member" />}
  loader={async () => {
    // Server-side auth validation
    return await validateAuthAndLoadData();
  }}
/>
```

#### 2. Role-Based Route Guards
```typescript
// Validate hierarchical permission checking
<Route
  path="/admin/*"
  element={<AdminRoute />}
  loader={async () => {
    // Admin-only access validation
    return await validateAdminAccess();
  }}
/>
```

#### 3. Nested Route Context
```typescript
// Validate parent-child route data sharing
<Route path="/events/:eventId" element={<EventLayout />}>
  <Route path="details" element={<EventDetails />} />
  <Route path="attendees" element={<EventAttendees />} />
  <Route path="edit" element={<EventEdit />} />
</Route>
```

### Performance Validation Requirements

#### Route Transition Speed
- **Target**: <100ms for cached routes
- **Measurement**: Performance.mark() timing for route changes
- **Test Scenarios**: Navigate between all route types under normal load

#### Bundle Size Optimization
- **Target**: Initial bundle <200KB, route chunks <50KB each
- **Measurement**: Webpack bundle analyzer reports
- **Test Scenarios**: Code splitting works for all major route groups

#### Memory Management
- **Target**: No memory leaks during navigation
- **Measurement**: Chrome DevTools memory profiling
- **Test Scenarios**: Navigate through all routes multiple times

## Examples/Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Guest User Navigation (Happy Path)
1. User visits witchcityrope.com
2. Clicks "About" → navigates to /about instantly
3. Clicks "Events" → sees public events at /events
4. Clicks specific event → sees event details at /events/rope-basics-101
5. Tries to register → redirected to /login
6. After login → automatically returns to /events/rope-basics-101/register

### Scenario 2: Member Role Progression
1. General Member logs in → dashboard at /dashboard
2. Clicks "All Events" → only sees public events
3. Applies for vetting → status tracked at /profile/vetting-status
4. After approval → now sees vetted events in /events
5. Member directory becomes accessible at /members

### Scenario 3: Admin Route Access
1. Admin logs in → full dashboard at /admin/dashboard
2. Navigates to /admin/users → user management interface
3. Clicks user details → nested route /admin/users/123/details
4. Breadcrumbs show: Home > Admin > Users > John Doe > Details
5. Admin can access all other user routes

### Scenario 4: Deep Linking and Sharing
1. Vetted member bookmarks /events/advanced-shibari-workshop
2. Later clicks bookmark → directly loads event page
3. Shares URL with another vetted member → works correctly
4. Shares with non-vetted member → they see access denied
5. URL parameters preserved: /events?category=advanced&instructor=jane

### Scenario 5: Error Handling
1. User types /nonexistent-page → sees custom 404 page
2. User loses internet mid-navigation → sees offline page
3. Server returns 500 error → sees error page with retry option
4. Session expires during navigation → redirected to login
5. All errors provide clear next steps
