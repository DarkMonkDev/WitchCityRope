# Business Requirements: DTO and Database Object Alignment Strategy
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-19 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary
This document establishes the architectural alignment strategy for data transfer objects (DTOs) and database entities between the React frontend and .NET API backend during the WitchCityRope migration project. The strategy ensures consistent data structures, prevents type mismatches, and establishes governance processes to maintain alignment throughout the migration and future development.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
During the React migration from Blazor Server, critical mismatches have been discovered between frontend expectations and backend API responses:

1. **Frontend Type Mismatches**: React TypeScript interfaces expect properties that don't exist in API responses (e.g., `user.firstName`, `user.roles`)
2. **Backend Response Inconsistencies**: API returns different property names than expected (e.g., `user.sceneName`, `user.createdAt` instead of expected names)
3. **Data Format Discrepancies**: Date formats, nullable properties, and nested response structures differ between expectations and reality
4. **Testing Failures**: Integration tests fail due to data structure mismatches
5. **Development Inefficiencies**: Developers waste time debugging data mapping issues

### Business Value
- **Reduced Development Time**: Eliminate 70% of API integration debugging time
- **Improved Code Quality**: Consistent data structures reduce bugs and maintenance overhead
- **Faster Feature Delivery**: Standardized patterns accelerate new feature development
- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Clear contracts reduce confusion and implementation errors
- **Production Stability**: Prevent runtime errors from data structure mismatches

### Success Metrics
- **Zero Type Mismatch Errors**: All frontend interfaces match backend DTOs exactly
- **90% Reduction in API Integration Issues**: Measured through support tickets and debugging time
- **100% Test Suite Success**: All integration tests pass with consistent data structures
- **30% Faster Feature Development**: Measured from requirements to production deployment

## User Stories

### Story 1: Frontend Developer Data Consistency
**As a** React frontend developer  
**I want to** have TypeScript interfaces that exactly match API response structures  
**So that** I can integrate with APIs without type casting or data transformation errors

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm consuming a user API endpoint
- When I receive the response data
- Then the TypeScript interface matches exactly with no type errors
- And I can access all properties without undefined checks for known fields

### Story 2: Backend Developer Contract Clarity
**As a** .NET API backend developer  
**I want to** know exactly what data structures the frontend expects  
**So that** I can design DTOs that meet frontend requirements without breaking changes

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm designing a new API endpoint
- When I create the response DTO
- Then I have clear specifications for property names, types, and nullability
- And I can validate compliance with established patterns

### Story 3: QA Engineer Testing Reliability
**As a** QA engineer  
**I want to** have reliable test data structures  
**So that** integration tests accurately reflect production behavior

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm writing integration tests
- When I mock API responses
- Then the test data matches actual production API responses exactly
- And tests fail meaningfully when data contracts change

### Story 4: API Consumer Backwards Compatibility
**As an** API consumer (React frontend)  
**I want to** receive consistent data structures over time  
**So that** my application doesn't break when the API is updated

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an existing API endpoint has been updated
- When I consume the updated endpoint
- Then existing properties remain unchanged (backwards compatible)
- And new properties are added without breaking existing functionality

### Story 5: DevOps Engineer Deployment Safety
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want to** validate API/frontend compatibility before deployment  
**So that** I can prevent production issues from data structure mismatches

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm deploying a new version
- When I run pre-deployment validation
- Then all data contract tests pass
- And any breaking changes are clearly identified and documented

### Story 6: Product Manager Feature Planning
**As a** product manager  
**I want to** understand the impact of data structure changes  
**So that** I can plan features and allocate development resources appropriately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm planning a feature that requires new data fields
- When I review the impact assessment
- Then I understand frontend, backend, and testing implications
- And I can make informed decisions about scope and timeline

### Story 7: System Administrator Monitoring
**As a** system administrator  
**I want to** monitor for data structure compatibility issues in production  
**So that** I can detect and respond to integration problems quickly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the system is running in production
- When data structure mismatches occur
- Then monitoring alerts notify me immediately
- And I have access to detailed error information for rapid resolution

### Story 8: Community Member Experience Consistency
**As a** WitchCityRope community member  
**I want to** have a seamless user experience across all platform features  
**So that** data inconsistencies don't impact my ability to participate in events and community activities

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm using the platform for any feature
- When data is displayed or submitted
- Then information is consistent and accurate across all interfaces
- And my user experience is not degraded by technical data issues

## Business Rules

### Data Structure Governance
1. **API as Source of Truth**: The existing .NET API DTOs serve as the authoritative data structure specification
2. **Backwards Compatibility Required**: Changes to API responses must maintain backwards compatibility for existing consumers
3. **Frontend Adaptation**: React TypeScript interfaces must adapt to match API DTOs, not the reverse
4. **Change Control Process**: All data structure changes require approval through established change management process
5. **Breaking Change Notification**: Any breaking changes must be communicated with minimum 30-day notice

### Property Naming Standards
1. **Consistent Naming Convention**: Follow established API naming patterns (camelCase for JSON responses)
2. **Descriptive Property Names**: Property names must clearly indicate their purpose and data type
3. **No Ambiguous Abbreviations**: Avoid shortened property names that could be misinterpreted
4. **Platform-Specific Considerations**: Respect community terminology (e.g., "sceneName" for community display name)

### Data Type Requirements
1. **Explicit Nullability**: All properties must clearly specify if null values are allowed
2. **Date Format Standardization**: All dates must use ISO 8601 format (UTC timezone)
3. **Consistent Collection Types**: Arrays and objects must follow established patterns
4. **Type Safety**: Strong typing required for all data structures

### Validation and Testing
1. **Automated Validation**: Automated tests must verify DTO/interface alignment
2. **Contract Testing**: Consumer-driven contract tests ensure API compatibility
3. **Pre-deployment Validation**: Data structure compatibility verified before production deployment
4. **Regular Audits**: Monthly reviews of data structure alignment and compliance

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Existing Database Schema**: Must work with current PostgreSQL database structure
- **ASP.NET Core Patterns**: Must follow established .NET API patterns and conventions
- **React TypeScript**: Frontend interfaces must be valid TypeScript with strict mode enabled
- **JSON Serialization**: All data must serialize/deserialize correctly using System.Text.Json

### Business Constraints
- **Migration Timeline**: Solution must not delay React migration project timeline
- **Development Resources**: Limited backend developer time for DTO changes
- **Community Impact**: No disruption to existing community member experience
- **Budget Limitations**: Prefer solutions that leverage existing technology stack

### Assumptions
- **API Stability**: Existing API endpoints are functioning correctly and represent desired data structures
- **Database Integrity**: Current database schema accurately represents business requirements
- **Development Team Skills**: Team has sufficient TypeScript and .NET knowledge for implementation
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Adequate testing environment exists for validation

## Security & Privacy Requirements

### Data Protection
1. **PII Handling**: Personal information in DTOs must comply with privacy requirements
2. **Role-Based Access**: DTOs must support role-based data filtering (Admin, Teacher, Vetted Member, General Member, Guest)
3. **Sensitive Data Masking**: Sensitive fields must be excludable from DTOs based on user permissions
4. **Audit Trail**: Changes to data structures must be logged for security auditing

### Consent Compliance
1. **Consent-Dependent Fields**: DTOs must support conditional field inclusion based on user consent preferences
2. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary fields included in each DTO based on use case
3. **Member Privacy Controls**: Support for member privacy settings affecting data visibility

## Compliance Requirements

### WitchCityRope Platform Policies
1. **Community Safety**: Data structures must support safety and consent workflows
2. **Age Verification**: DTOs must handle age verification status and 18+ requirements
3. **Vetting Status**: Support for multi-tier membership vetting levels
4. **Anonymous Reporting**: DTOs must support anonymous incident reporting features

### Technical Standards
1. **GDPR Compliance**: Support for data export, deletion, and portability requirements
2. **Security Standards**: Follow established security patterns for sensitive data
3. **API Versioning**: Support for API versioning to manage breaking changes

## Examples/Scenarios

### Scenario 1: User Authentication Data (Current Issue)
**Current Problem**:
```typescript
// Frontend expects:
interface User {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  roles: string[];
}

// API actually returns:
{
  "sceneName": "RopeArtist123",
  "createdAt": "2023-08-19T10:30:00Z",
  "lastLoginAt": "2023-08-19T08:15:00Z"
}
```

**Solution**:
```typescript
// Aligned interface matching API:
interface User {
  sceneName: string;
  createdAt: string;
  lastLoginAt: string | null;
}
```

### Scenario 2: Event Registration Data
**Optimized Structure**:
```typescript
// API DTO:
public class EventRegistrationDto
{
    public Guid EventId { get; set; }
    public string EventTitle { get; set; }
    public DateTime EventDate { get; set; }
    public string AttendeeSceneName { get; set; }
    public RegistrationStatus Status { get; set; }
    public decimal? PaymentAmount { get; set; }
}

// Matching TypeScript interface:
interface EventRegistration {
  eventId: string;
  eventTitle: string;
  eventDate: string; // ISO 8601 format
  attendeeSceneName: string;
  status: 'pending' | 'confirmed' | 'cancelled';
  paymentAmount: number | null;
}
```

### Scenario 3: Member Vetting Status
**Privacy-Aware Structure**:
```typescript
// Role-based DTO variations:
interface MemberVettingStatus {
  memberId: string;
  sceneName: string;
  vettingLevel: 'guest' | 'general' | 'vetted' | 'teacher' | 'admin';
  vettingDate: string | null;
  // Sensitive fields only for admin view:
  realName?: string; // Only for admin users
  referenceContacts?: string[]; // Only for admin users
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### For React Developers
1. **Never Assume Data Structure**: Always check actual API responses before creating interfaces
2. **Use API Documentation**: Reference generated API documentation for exact DTO structures
3. **Handle Nullable Properties**: Explicitly handle null/undefined values in TypeScript
4. **Test with Real Data**: Use actual API responses in tests, not mocked ideal structures

### For Backend Developers
1. **Document DTOs Thoroughly**: Include property descriptions, types, and nullability
2. **Version Breaking Changes**: Use API versioning for any breaking DTO changes
3. **Validate Data Contracts**: Run tests against frontend expectations before deployment
4. **Communicate Changes**: Notify frontend team of any DTO modifications

### For QA Engineers
1. **Test Real API Responses**: Validate that actual API responses match documented DTOs
2. **Verify Interface Alignment**: Test that frontend correctly handles all API response variations
3. **Monitor for Null Handling**: Ensure frontend gracefully handles null/undefined values
4. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Verify data handling across different browsers and devices
