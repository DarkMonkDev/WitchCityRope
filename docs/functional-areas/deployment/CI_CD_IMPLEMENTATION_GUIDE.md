# CI/CD Implementation Guide for WitchCityRope

## Overview

This guide describes the comprehensive CI/CD implementation for automated Playwright test execution, integrating with the working authentication patterns and Docker-based environment established for the WitchCityRope application.

## Architecture Decision: GitHub Actions

**Chosen Platform**: GitHub Actions with Docker integration

**Rationale**:
- Native integration with existing GitHub repository
- Excellent Docker support for consistent test environments
- Matrix builds for multi-browser testing
- Artifact management and reporting capabilities
- Cost-effective for the project scale
- Strong community and marketplace ecosystem

## Implementation Components

### 1. Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow

**File**: `.github/workflows/playwright-ci-enhanced.yml`

**Key Features**:
- **Multi-stage Pipeline**: Setup → Docker Environment → Test Execution → Reporting → Cleanup
- **Matrix Strategy**: Parallel execution across browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Test Categorization**: Smoke, auth, events, admin, validation, RSVP, UI, API tests
- **Smart Scheduling**: Different test suites based on trigger (PR vs push vs nightly)
- **Environment Support**: Docker, staging, and local environments
- **Artifact Management**: Screenshots, videos, traces, and reports with retention policies

### 2. Environment-Specific Configuration

#### CI Environment Variables (`.env.ci`)
- PostgreSQL test database configuration
- JWT secrets and authentication settings
- Application URLs and API endpoints
- Resource limits and performance optimization
- Mock configurations for external services

#### CI-Optimized Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ci.ts`)
- Single worker execution for CI stability
- Enhanced retry logic (3 retries in CI vs 1 locally)
- Comprehensive reporting (HTML, JSON, JUnit, GitHub Actions)
- Browser-specific optimizations with CI-friendly flags
- Resource-conscious settings

#### Docker CI Configuration (`docker-compose.ci.yml`)
- Optimized resource limits (1G memory, 0.5 CPU for most services)
- Temporary filesystem for PostgreSQL data (faster I/O)
- Reduced logging verbosity
- Health checks with shorter intervals
- No restart policies (appropriate for CI)

### 3. Test Categorization System

**File**: `tests/playwright/test-categories.json`

**Categories**:
- **Smoke** (Critical): Basic functionality tests that must pass
- **Auth**: Authentication and authorization tests using working patterns
- **Events**: Event management and display functionality
- **Admin**: Administrative dashboard and management features
- **Validation**: Form validation and input validation tests
- **RSVP**: Member RSVP and ticketing functionality
- **UI**: User interface and navigation tests
- **API**: Backend API endpoint tests
- **Visual Regression**: Screenshot comparison tests (Chromium only)
- **Performance**: Load and performance testing (nightly only)

**Execution Strategies**:
- **CI-Fast**: Smoke tests only (5-10 minutes)
- **CI-Standard**: Core functionality (15-20 minutes)
- **CI-Full**: Comprehensive test suite (25-35 minutes)
- **Nightly**: Complete testing including visual and performance

### 4. Enhanced Test Runner Script

**File**: `scripts/run-playwright-categorized.sh`

**Features**:
- Command-line interface for category-based test execution
- Environment detection and setup (Docker/local/staging)
- Prerequisite checking (Docker, Node.js, .NET)
- Service health monitoring and startup verification
- Automatic cleanup and resource management
- Colored output and detailed logging

**Usage Examples**:
```bash
# Quick smoke test
./scripts/run-playwright-categorized.sh --category smoke

# Full auth testing with Firefox
./scripts/run-playwright-categorized.sh --category auth --browser firefox --headed

# Debug mode for troubleshooting
./scripts/run-playwright-categorized.sh --category events --debug
```

### 5. Authentication Pattern Integration

The CI/CD setup leverages the working authentication patterns established in the codebase:

**Global Setup** (`tests/playwright/helpers/global-setup.ts`):
- Pre-authenticates all test user types (admin, member, teacher, vetted, guest)
- Saves authentication states for reuse across tests
- Verifies application readiness before test execution
- Handles Blazor-specific initialization patterns

**Authentication Helpers** (existing `tests/playwright/helpers/auth.helpers.ts`):
- Reuses working login selectors and patterns
- Session state management and validation
- Role-based access verification
- Blazor SignalR connection handling

### 6. Comprehensive Reporting and Artifact Management

#### Test Reporting
- **HTML Reports**: Rich interactive reports with screenshots and traces
- **JSON/JUnit**: Machine-readable formats for CI integration
- **GitHub Actions Integration**: Native PR comments and check annotations
- **Artifact Retention**: 7 days for debug artifacts, 30 days for reports

#### Performance and Accessibility Testing
**Lighthouse CI** (`.lighthouserc.js`):
- Performance budgets and thresholds
- Accessibility compliance testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- SEO and best practices validation
- Integration with GitHub Actions for automated quality gates

### 7. Environment Setup Requirements

#### Local Development
```bash
# Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18.x or later  
- npm or yarn

# Quick start
npm ci
npx playwright install --with-deps
./scripts/run-playwright-categorized.sh --category smoke
```

#### CI Environment
- Ubuntu 22.04 (latest GitHub Actions runner)
- Docker with BuildKit support
- Node.js 18.x with npm cache
- PostgreSQL 16 (containerized)
- Headless browsers with system dependencies

#### Staging Environment
- HTTPS endpoints with valid certificates
- VPN access for test execution
- Staging-specific test accounts
- External monitoring integration

## Test Execution Strategy

### Pull Request Testing
1. **Smoke Tests**: Critical path verification (5 minutes)
2. **Changed Area Tests**: Tests related to modified files
3. **Browser Matrix**: Chromium + Firefox for main functionality

### Main Branch Testing
