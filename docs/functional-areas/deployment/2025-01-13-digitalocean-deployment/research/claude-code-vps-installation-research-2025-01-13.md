## Technology Options Evaluated

### Option A: Install Claude Code on Production VPS
**Overview**: Install Claude Code CLI directly on the 8GB DigitalOcean droplet running production and staging environments
**Version Evaluated**: Claude Code CLI latest (as of January 2025)
**Documentation Quality**: Excellent - Comprehensive installation guides and system requirements

**Pros**:
- **Direct File Access**: Immediate access to logs, configurations, and application files without network latency
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Can monitor system resources, Docker containers, and application performance directly
- **Complete Context**: Full system visibility for troubleshooting complex issues
- **Offline Capability**: Works during local network outages (still requires internet for Claude API)

**Cons**:
- **Critical Security Risk**: AI assistant with file system access on production server presents significant attack surface
- **Resource Competition**: Minimum 4GB RAM requirement competes with production/staging containers on 8GB system
- **Single Point of Failure**: If Claude Code process crashes or consumes excessive resources, could impact production services
- **Update Complexity**: Maintaining Claude Code updates on production server adds operational overhead

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- **Safety/Privacy**: **HIGH RISK** - Production server access could expose sensitive community member data
- **Mobile Experience**: No direct impact on mobile users
- **Learning Curve**: **MODERATE** - Team must learn Claude Code + production server management
- **Community Values**: **CONFLICTS** with security-first approach for sensitive community platform

### Option B: Remote Claude Code Assistance via SSH MCP Server
**Overview**: Use Claude Code locally/remotely with SSH MCP server for secure remote access to production systems
**Version Evaluated**: SSH MCP Server + Claude Code remote capabilities (January 2025)
**Documentation Quality**: Good - Multiple implementation guides available, growing ecosystem

**Pros**:
- **Production Isolation**: Claude Code runs separately from production environment, eliminating resource competition
- **Security Layer**: SSH key authentication with encrypted connections, no permanent AI presence on production
- **Cost Efficiency**: Zero additional server costs, uses existing SSH infrastructure
- **Flexible Access**: Team members can connect from their own development environments
- **Proven Pattern**: SSH access is established security practice for server management

**Cons**:
- **Network Dependency**: Requires stable internet connection to production server
- **Latency Impact**: File operations may be slower due to network round-trips
- **Connection Management**: SSH connection failures require reconnection setup
- **Initial Complexity**: Requires proper SSH key setup and MCP server configuration

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- **Safety/Privacy**: **EXCELLENT** - No permanent AI presence on production, controlled access through existing SSH security
- **Mobile Experience**: No direct impact on mobile users
- **Learning Curve**: **LOW** - Team already uses SSH, MCP adds familiar CLI-like interaction
- **Community Values**: **ALIGNS** with security-conscious approach and volunteer-friendly simplicity

### Option C: Hybrid Approach - Dedicated Management Droplet
**Overview**: Deploy separate $4/month DigitalOcean droplet (1GB RAM) for Claude Code with SSH access to production
**Version Evaluated**: DigitalOcean Basic Droplet + Claude Code CLI
**Documentation Quality**: Good - Standard DigitalOcean and Claude Code documentation applies

**Pros**:
- **Resource Isolation**: Completely separate from production environment
- **Persistent Access**: Always-on Claude Code instance for monitoring and automation
- **Cost Predictable**: $4/month additional cost, within reasonable budget for larger operations
- **Security Boundary**: Jump box pattern provides controlled access point

**Cons**:
- **Budget Constraint**: $4/month exceeds remaining $8 budget when considering bandwidth and storage
- **Increased Complexity**: Additional server to manage, monitor, and secure
- **Resource Limits**: 1GB RAM may limit Claude Code effectiveness for complex operations
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Two servers to update, backup, and monitor instead of one

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- **Safety/Privacy**: **GOOD** - Isolated environment with controlled access
- **Mobile Experience**: No direct impact on mobile users
- **Learning Curve**: **HIGH** - Team must manage additional server infrastructure
- **Community Values**: **ACCEPTABLE** but adds operational complexity for volunteers
