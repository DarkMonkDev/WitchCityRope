# WitchCityRope Deployment - Current Status
**Date**: October 10, 2025, 11:40 PM EST
**Session**: Infrastructure Setup (Day 1 & Partial Day 2)
**Status**: Phase 1 Infrastructure Complete - Ready for Application Deployment

## Quick Summary
We have completed **Day 1** and **partial Day 2** of the 5-day implementation plan. The server infrastructure is fully set up with SSL, databases, and Nginx configured. We are now at the point where we need to deploy the actual Docker containers with the React app and API.

## üö® Critical Missing Items

### From Day 2 Afternoon (Application Deployment):
1. **Docker Compose Configuration Files**
   - `/opt/witchcityrope/production/docker-compose.yml` - NOT created
   - `/opt/witchcityrope/staging/docker-compose.yml` - NOT created
   - Environment variable files for containers - NOT created

2. **Docker Images**
   - React production image - NOT built
   - API production image - NOT built
   - Images NOT pushed to DigitalOcean Container Registry

3. **Running Containers**
   - Production React container (port 3001) - NOT running
   - Production API container (port 5001) - NOT running
   - Staging React container (port 3002) - NOT running
   - Staging API container (port 5002) - NOT running
   - Redis cache container - NOT configured or running

4. **Application Code**
   - Repository NOT cloned to server (encountered SSH key issues)
   - OR: Code should be in Docker images (preferred for CI/CD push strategy)

5. **Database Migrations**
   - Initial database schema NOT created
   - Migrations NOT run on production database
   - Migrations NOT run on staging database

---

## üìã What the Original Plan Expected at This Point

According to `deployment-procedures.md` **Phase 5: Application Deployment**, script `05-deploy-application.sh` should have:

1. ‚úÖ Created Docker Compose configurations ‚ùå **NOT DONE**
2. ‚úÖ Built or pulled Docker images ‚ùå **NOT DONE**
3. ‚úÖ Deployed production and staging environments ‚ùå **NOT DONE**
4. ‚úÖ Created management scripts ‚ùå **NOT DONE**
5. ‚úÖ Run health checks ‚ùå **NOT DONE**

**Expected Verification Commands** (from plan):
```bash
# Check application status
/opt/witchcityrope/status.sh  # Script doesn't exist

# Test API endpoints
curl https://notfai.com/api/health  # Returns 502 Bad Gateway (no backend)

# View container logs
/opt/witchcityrope/logs.sh production api  # Script doesn't exist
```

**Current Reality**:
```bash
# Nginx is running and configured
curl https://notfai.com/  # Returns 502 Bad Gateway (no backend on port 3001)
curl https://staging.notfai.com/  # Returns 502 Bad Gateway (no backend on port 3002)

# No containers running
docker ps  # Shows no witchcityrope containers

# No docker-compose files exist
ls /opt/witchcityrope/production/  # Directory exists but empty except failed git clone

# No management scripts created
ls /opt/witchcityrope/*.sh  # No status.sh, logs.sh, backup.sh, etc.
```

---

## üéØ Immediate Next Steps (To Complete Day 2)

### Priority 1: Create Docker Infrastructure (Required)
1. **Create Dockerfiles** (if not in repo)
   - `Dockerfile.react` - Production React build
   - `Dockerfile.api` - Production API build

2. **Create Docker Compose Files**
   - `/opt/witchcityrope/production/docker-compose.yml`
   - `/opt/witchcityrope/staging/docker-compose.yml`
   - Define services: web (React), api (.NET), redis (cache)
   - Configure environment variables
   - Set up networks and volumes

3. **Build and Push Docker Images**
   - Build React production image locally
   - Build API production image locally
   - Push images to DigitalOcean Container Registry
   - OR: Set up GitHub Actions to build and push (CI/CD approach)

4. **Deploy Containers**
   - Pull images on server (if using registry)
   - `docker-compose up -d` for production
   - `docker-compose up -d` for staging
   - Verify containers are running

5. **Run Database Migrations**
   - Connect to API container
   - Run EF Core migrations against production database
   - Run EF Core migrations against staging database
   - Verify schema created

6. **Test Application**
   - Verify https://notfai.com loads React app
   - Verify https://notfai.com/api/health returns 200 OK
   - Test authentication flow
   - Verify staging environment works

### Priority 2: Management Scripts (Recommended)
Create helper scripts mentioned in the plan:
- `/opt/witchcityrope/status.sh` - Check all containers
- `/opt/witchcityrope/logs.sh` - View container logs
- `/opt/witchcityrope/restart.sh` - Restart services
- `/opt/witchcityrope/backup-full-database.sh` - Database backups

---

## üîÑ CI/CD Deployment Strategy (Confirmed)

**Decision Made**: Push-based CI/CD using GitHub Actions

**Workflow**:
1. Developer pushes code to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions builds Docker images
3. GitHub Actions pushes images to DigitalOcean Container Registry
4. GitHub Actions SSHs into server
5. Server pulls latest images
6. Server runs `docker-compose up -d` to update containers

**SSH Key Created**: `/home/witchcity/.ssh/witchcity-deploy` (on server)
- **Purpose**: GitHub Actions will use this to SSH into server
- **Action Required**: Add private key to GitHub Secrets as `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`

## üìä Current Infrastructure State

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- Server accessible via SSH
- Docker and Docker Compose installed and working
- Nginx running with reverse proxy configured
- SSL certificates active for all 3 domains
- Databases created and accessible
- Firewall properly configured
- DNS pointing to server

### ‚ùå What's NOT Working:
- No application containers running
- No Docker Compose files exist
- No Docker images built or pushed
- Database schemas not created (no migrations run)
- Application code not deployed
- Health check endpoints return 502

### üîç Current State of Domains:
```bash
https://notfai.com ‚Üí Nginx ‚Üí 502 Bad Gateway (no app on port 3001)
https://www.notfai.com ‚Üí Nginx ‚Üí 502 Bad Gateway (no app on port 3001)
https://staging.notfai.com ‚Üí Nginx ‚Üí 502 Bad Gateway (no app on port 3002)
```

## üìÖ Remaining Work (From 5-Day Plan)

### Day 2 Afternoon (3-4 hours remaining):
- Complete Task 2.3: Application Deployment
- Complete Task 2.4: Initial Application Testing

### Day 3: CI/CD Configuration (4-6 hours)
- Task 3.1: Monitoring Setup
- Task 3.2: Backup System Configuration
- Task 3.3: GitHub Actions Configuration
- Task 3.4: CI/CD Testing

### Day 4: Testing and Validation (6-8 hours)
- Performance testing
- Security validation
- Backup/recovery testing
- End-to-end application testing

### Day 5: Go-Live and Monitoring (4-6 hours)
- Pre-launch verification
- Production launch
- Post-launch monitoring
- Documentation and handoff

## üí° Recommendations

### Option A: Continue with Manual Deployment (Tonight)
1. Create docker-compose files manually
2. Build images locally
3. Push to registry or copy to server
4. Deploy containers
5. Run migrations
6. **Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### Option B: Set Up CI/CD First (Better Long-term)
1. Create GitHub Actions workflow
2. Add Dockerfiles to repository
3. Configure GitHub Secrets
4. Push code to trigger automatic deployment
5. **Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours (but sets up automation)

### Recommended: **Option B** (CI/CD First)
**Rationale**:
- Sets up proper deployment process from the start
- Avoids manual deployments going forward
- Aligns with original plan (Day 3 task)
- Only 1 hour more time investment
- Pays off immediately with automated deployments

## üìù Summary

**What We've Accomplished**:
- ‚úÖ Complete server infrastructure (Day 1 - 100%)
- ‚úÖ SSL certificates and Nginx reverse proxy (Day 2 Morning - 100%)
- ‚úÖ Database provisioning and configuration (Day 2 Morning - 100%)

**What We're Missing**:
- ‚ùå Docker Compose configurations
- ‚ùå Docker images built and pushed
- ‚ùå Application containers running
- ‚ùå Database migrations executed
- ‚ùå Application deployed and accessible

**Next Critical Step**:
**Create Docker Compose files and deploy application containers** to complete Day 2 afternoon tasks.

**Current Blocker**:
We need to decide on deployment approach:
1. Manual docker-compose deployment tonight
2. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow first (recommended)
