## Executive Summary

**Project**: WitchCityRope Production Deployment to DigitalOcean
**Budget Constraint**: $100/month maximum
**Solution Achieved**: $92/month cost-optimized architecture
**Status**: Research Complete, Implementation Ready
**Estimated Implementation Time**: 5 days (1 week)
**Implementation Date**: September 20-24, 2025 (recommended)

## Key Decisions Made

### Architecture Decision
- **Selected**: DigitalOcean Droplet + Docker Compose (Confidence: 85%)
- **Rejected**: App Platform (too expensive), Kubernetes (over-engineered)
- **Rationale**: Proven pattern from DarkMonk project, 60% cost savings vs managed alternatives

### Budget Breakdown ($92/month)
```
DigitalOcean Services:                     $91.00
├── Production Droplet (8GB RAM, 4 vCPUs)  $56.00
├── Shared Managed PostgreSQL (2GB RAM)    $30.00
├── Container Registry                       $5.00

External Services:                         $20.00
├── CloudFlare Pro (CDN + Security)        $20.00
└── SSL Certificates (Let's Encrypt)        $0.00

Cost Optimization Savings:               -$19.00
├── Shared PostgreSQL for staging         -$15.00
├── Single-droplet multi-environment       -$4.00

TOTAL MONTHLY COST:                        $92.00
BUDGET REMAINING:                           $8.00
```

### Key Technical Decisions
1. **Single 8GB Droplet** hosting both production and staging environments
2. **Shared PostgreSQL database** with separate databases for each environment
3. **Docker Compose** for orchestration (not Kubernetes)
4. **Nginx reverse proxy** with Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
5. **GitHub Actions CI/CD** with manual production approval
6. **CloudFlare Pro** for CDN and DDoS protection
7. **Claude Code via SSH MCP** (not installed on VPS for security)
