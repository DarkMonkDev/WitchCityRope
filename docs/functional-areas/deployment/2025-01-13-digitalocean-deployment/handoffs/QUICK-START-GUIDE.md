## Common Pitfalls to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è

### DNS Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: SSL certificates fail because DNS not propagated
- **Solution**: Verify DNS with `nslookup` before running SSL setup
- **Wait Time**: Allow 30+ minutes for DNS propagation

### Database Connection Failures
- **Problem**: Application can't connect to PostgreSQL
- **Solution**: Verify database credentials and VPC configuration
- **Check**: Ensure droplet is in same region as database

### Docker Permission Issues
- **Problem**: User can't run docker commands
- **Solution**: Add user to docker group and log out/in
- **Command**: `sudo usermod -aG docker witchcity`

### SSL Certificate Problems
- **Problem**: Let's Encrypt rate limits or validation failures
- **Solution**: Use staging SSL first, then production
- **Debug**: Check `/var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log`

### Container Startup Failures
- **Problem**: Containers exit immediately or become unhealthy
- **Solution**: Check environment variables and logs
- **Debug**: `docker logs container-name` and verify `.env` files

## Verification Steps

### After Each Day
1. **Document Progress**: Note what was completed and any issues
2. **Backup Configuration**: Save current state before next day
3. **Test Critical Paths**: Ensure previous functionality still works
4. **Update Team**: Send status update to stakeholders

### Final Verification Checklist
- [ ] **Performance**: Page loads < 2 seconds, API < 500ms
- [ ] **Security**: SSL A+ rating, security headers present
- [ ] **Functionality**: All user workflows working
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Health checks every 5 minutes
- [ ] **Backup**: Daily automated backups verified
- [ ] **Cost**: Monthly usage tracking under $95

## Emergency Contacts

### If Something Goes Wrong
1. **Infrastructure Issues**: DigitalOcean Support (24/7)
2. **SSL Problems**: Let's Encrypt Community Forums
3. **Application Issues**: Check container logs and GitHub Issues
4. **Database Issues**: DigitalOcean Managed Database Support

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Application rollback
