- **Why Not Selected**: Less proven for managed PostgreSQL, smaller community

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Single Droplet Multi-Environment Architecture

**Decision**: Use one 8GB droplet for both production and staging
**Alternative**: Separate droplets for each environment
**Reasoning**:
- **Cost Savings**: $24/month saved vs separate staging droplet
- **Resource Efficiency**: Staging uses only 2GB RAM, leaving 6GB for production
- **Simplified Management**: Single server to maintain and monitor
- **Port Isolation**: Complete separation via different port ranges

### 2. Shared PostgreSQL Database

**Decision**: Single managed PostgreSQL instance with separate databases
**Alternative**: Separate database instances for each environment
**Reasoning**:
- **Cost Savings**: $15/month saved vs separate staging database
- **Resource Efficiency**: Staging database usage is minimal
- **Data Consistency**: Same PostgreSQL version and configuration
- **Backup Simplification**: Single backup strategy covers both environments

### 3. Docker Compose Over Kubernetes

**Decision**: Use Docker Compose for container orchestration
**Alternative**: Kubernetes for enterprise-grade orchestration
**Reasoning**:
- **Simplicity**: Volunteer team familiar with Docker Compose from development
- **Resource Requirements**: No overhead of Kubernetes control plane
- **Maintenance**: Simple configuration files vs complex YAML manifests
- **Cost**: No additional orchestration costs

### 4. Nginx + Let's Encrypt Over Caddy

**Decision**: Use Nginx reverse proxy with Let's Encrypt certificates
**Alternative**: Caddy with automatic HTTPS
**Reasoning**:
- **Performance**: Nginx proven for high-performance reverse proxy
- **Community Knowledge**: Team familiar with Nginx configuration
- **Flexibility**: More configuration options for complex routing
- **Certificate Management**: Let's Encrypt integration well-documented

### 5. CloudFlare Pro Integration

**Decision**: Use CloudFlare Pro CDN ($20/month)
**Alternative**: DigitalOcean CDN or no CDN
**Reasoning**:
- **Performance**: 40-60% faster page loads globally
- **DDoS Protection**: Essential for community platform security
- **Web Application Firewall**: Protects against common attacks
- **Cache Optimization**: Reduces server load and improves user experience

### 6. GitHub Actions CI/CD

**Decision**: Use GitHub Actions for automated deployment
**Alternative**: Jenkins, GitLab CI, or manual deployment
**Reasoning**:
- **Integration**: Native GitHub integration with repository
- **Cost**: Free for open source projects
- **Simplicity**: YAML configuration, no separate CI server maintenance
- **Community**: Extensive action marketplace and documentation

### 7. Claude Code Remote Access Strategy

**Decision**: Claude Code via SSH MCP Server (not installed on VPS)
**Alternative**: Install Claude Code tools directly on server
**Reasoning**:
- **Security**: No additional attack surface on production server
- **Maintenance**: Remote troubleshooting without server modifications
- **Flexibility**: Can connect from any development machine
- **Cost**: No additional server resources required

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection Strategy
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS 1.3 for all communications
