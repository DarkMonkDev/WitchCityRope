## Architecture Decisions

### Q: Why use a single droplet instead of separate production and staging servers?

**A:** Cost optimization and resource efficiency.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Cost Savings**: Single 8GB droplet ($56/month) vs two 4GB droplets ($48/month each = $96/month)
- **Resource Efficiency**: Staging environment only needs 2GB RAM, leaving 6GB for production
- **Simplified Management**: One server to maintain, monitor, and backup
- **Complete Isolation**: Different port ranges (prod: 3001/5001, staging: 3002/5002) provide full separation
- **Proven Pattern**: DarkMonk project successfully uses this architecture

**Scaling Path**: When community grows beyond 600 members, we can easily scale to separate servers.

### Q: Why Docker Compose instead of Kubernetes?

**A:** Simplicity and volunteer-friendly maintenance.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Learning Curve**: Volunteer team already familiar with Docker Compose from development
- **Operational Complexity**: Kubernetes requires specialized knowledge for maintenance
- **Cost**: No Kubernetes control plane overhead ($60+ monthly vs $0)
- **Right-Sizing**: Application doesn't need enterprise orchestration features
- **Maintenance**: Simple YAML files vs complex Kubernetes manifests

**Future Consideration**: Can migrate to Kubernetes when application complexity justifies the overhead.

### Q: Why shared PostgreSQL database instead of separate instances?

**A:** Significant cost savings with proper isolation.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Cost Impact**: Shared 2GB database ($30/month) vs separate instances ($30 + $15 = $45/month)
- **Isolation**: Completely separate databases (`witchcityrope_prod` and `witchcityrope_staging`)
- **Security**: Different connection strings and user permissions
- **Performance**: Staging usage is minimal, doesn't impact production
- **Backup**: Simplified backup strategy covers both environments

**Risk Mitigation**: Staging operations are limited and won't affect production performance.

### Q: Why Claude Code via SSH instead of installing on the server?

**A:** Security and resource optimization.

**Detailed Explanation**:
- **Security**: No additional attack surface on production server
- **Resource Usage**: No memory/CPU consumption on server for development tools
- **Flexibility**: Can connect from any development machine with SSH MCP
- **Maintenance**: No additional server-side software to maintain
- **Cost**: No impact on server resources or hosting costs

**Access Method**: Use SSH MCP Server from local development environment.

## Cost and Budget Questions

### Q: How do we achieve $92/month when other platforms cost $200+?

**A:** Strategic cost optimization through shared resources and right-sizing.

**Cost Breakdown**:
```
DigitalOcean Services:             $91.00/month
├── Single 8GB Droplet             $56.00
├── Shared PostgreSQL (2GB)        $30.00
└── Container Registry              $5.00

External Services:                 $20.00/month
└── CloudFlare Pro                  $20.00

Cost Optimizations:               -$19.00/month
├── Shared database (vs separate)  -$15.00
└── Single droplet (vs multiple)   -$4.00

Total Monthly Cost:               $92.00/month
```

**Comparison**: AWS/Azure equivalent would be $180-220/month, managed platforms $150-200/month.

### Q: What happens if we exceed the $100/month budget?

**A:** Multiple safeguards prevent budget overruns.

**Prevention Measures**:
- **Billing Alerts**: Set at 80% ($80/month) for early warning
- **Resource Monitoring**: Track usage trends and patterns
- **Automatic Scaling**: Policies prevent runaway resource consumption
- **Monthly Reviews**: Regular cost analysis and optimization

**Response Plan**:
1. **Immediate**: Scale down non-essential services
2. **Short-term**: Optimize resource usage and remove inefficiencies
3. **Long-term**: Consider upgrading budget or alternative architectures

### Q: Can we reduce costs further below $92/month?

**A:** Limited optimization opportunities without compromising functionality.

**Current Optimization Opportunities**:
- **Reserved Instances**: 10-15% discount with annual commitment
- **Power Scheduling**: Scale down staging during off-hours (complex automation)
- **CDN Optimization**: Fine-tune CloudFlare caching (minimal impact)

**Not Recommended**:
- Smaller droplet (would impact performance)
- Removing staging environment (would impact development workflow)
- Self-managed database (increases operational complexity)
