## Phase 2: Docker Deployment & CI/CD - NEXT

### Deployment Strategy (Confirmed)
**Push-based CI/CD** using GitHub Actions:
- GitHub Actions builds Docker images on commit
- GitHub Actions pushes images to DigitalOcean Container Registry
- GitHub Actions deploys to server via SSH
- Server runs docker-compose to start/update containers

**Why Push-based?**
1. Centralized control from GitHub
2. Better security (server doesn't need write access to repo)
3. Atomic deployments coordinated by GitHub Actions
4. Clear deployment history in GitHub Actions logs
5. Easier rollbacks and version management

### Next Steps (Phase 2)
1. **Create Docker Images**
   - [ ] Build React production image
   - [ ] Build API production image
   - [ ] Test images locally
   - [ ] Push to DigitalOcean Container Registry

2. **Create docker-compose.yml Files**
   - [ ] Production environment configuration
   - [ ] Staging environment configuration
   - [ ] Environment variable management
   - [ ] Network and volume configuration

3. **Configure GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - [ ] Build and push Docker images workflow
   - [ ] Deploy to staging workflow (on push to staging branch)
   - [ ] Deploy to production workflow (manual trigger)
   - [ ] Add GitHub Secrets for server SSH access

4. **Database Migrations**
   - [ ] Run initial database schema migrations
   - [ ] Verify production database connectivity
   - [ ] Verify staging database connectivity
   - [ ] Seed test data in staging

5. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Deploy to staging environment
   - [ ] Run E2E tests against staging
   - [ ] Verify SSL certificates
   - [ ] Performance testing
   - [ ] Security scanning

6. **Production Launch**
   - [ ] Deploy to production environment
   - [ ] DNS cutover (if moving from witchcityrope.com)
   - [ ] Monitor application health
   - [ ] Backup verification
   - [ ] Document post-launch procedures

### SSH Keys for CI/CD
**Server Deploy Key**: Already created on server at `/home/witchcity/.ssh/witchcity-deploy`
- **Public Key**: Add to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` (already done)
- **Private Key**: Add to GitHub Secrets as `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`
- **Purpose**: GitHub Actions uses this key to SSH into server for deployments

### Required GitHub Secrets
```
DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN: dop_v1_a830e104efd3e604de2815b7c2810dbaa5488a451b2a36344aa808d03b6ec427
SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: <contents of /home/witchcity/.ssh/witchcity-deploy>
SSH_HOST: 104.131.165.14
SSH_USER: witchcity
PROD_DB_CONNECTION_STRING: <from /opt/witchcityrope/database-credentials.env>
STAGING_DB_CONNECTION_STRING: <from /opt/witchcityrope/database-credentials.env>
```
