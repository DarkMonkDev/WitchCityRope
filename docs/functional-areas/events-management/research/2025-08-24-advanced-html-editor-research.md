## Implementation Considerations

### Migration Path from @mantine/tiptap
1. **Phase 1** (Week 1): Install Tiptap v2 core and essential extensions
2. **Phase 2** (Week 1): Configure basic text formatting (bold, italic, lists)
3. **Phase 3** (Week 2): Add advanced features (tables, colors, font sizes)
4. **Phase 4** (Week 2): Implement image upload and code blocks
5. **Phase 5** (Week 3): Custom styling integration with Mantine theme
6. **Phase 6** (Week 3): Testing and optimization

**Estimated Effort**: 3 weeks part-time development
**Risk Level**: Low - incremental upgrade from existing Mantine Tiptap

### Integration Points
- **Mantine Theme**: Tiptap can inherit Mantine color scheme and typography
- **Form Integration**: Compatible with React Hook Form and Mantine form components
- **File Upload**: Integrates with existing image upload infrastructure
- **API Compatibility**: HTML output compatible with existing backend storage

### Performance Impact
- **Bundle Size**: +135KB gzipped (acceptable for feature richness)
- **Runtime Performance**: Minimal impact, optimized for large documents
- **Memory Usage**: ~2-5MB additional RAM (efficient for rich text editing)
- **Mobile Performance**: Touch-optimized, maintains 60fps scrolling

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Browser Compatibility**: IE11 not supported (acceptable - platform targets modern browsers)
  - **Mitigation**: Document minimum browser requirements, provide fallback messaging

### Medium Risk
- **Complex Configuration**: Advanced features require learning ProseMirror concepts
  - **Mitigation**: Start with basic configuration, add features incrementally
- **Extension Dependencies**: Multiple packages needed for full feature set
  - **Mitigation**: Bundle essential extensions, lazy-load advanced features

### Low Risk
- **Breaking Changes**: v2 is stable with semantic versioning
  - **Monitoring**: Subscribe to release notifications, test updates in staging
- **Performance Impact**: Bundle size increase manageable with code splitting
  - **Monitoring**: Monitor Core Web Vitals, implement progressive loading

## Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: Tiptap v2
**Confidence Level**: HIGH (85%)

**Rationale**:
1. **Complete Feature Coverage**: Only option that meets 100% of must-have requirements while maintaining reasonable bundle size
2. **Existing Foundation**: Team already familiar with Tiptap basics from @mantine/tiptap implementation
3. **Optimal Trade-offs**: Best balance of features, performance, and maintainability for WitchCityRope's needs
4. **Community Alignment**: Open source, extensible architecture aligns with platform values
5. **Mobile-First**: Touch-optimized interface suitable for community members using phones at events

**Implementation Priority**: Immediate - can begin integration next sprint

### Alternative Recommendations
- **Second Choice**: Lexical (for performance-critical use cases) - Consider when framework reaches 1.0 stability
- **Future Consideration**: TinyMCE (for enterprise features) - If budget allows for premium features
