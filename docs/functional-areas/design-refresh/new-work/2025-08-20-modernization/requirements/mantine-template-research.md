const theme = createTheme({
  colors: {
    witchcity: [
      '#f8f4e6', // ivory (lightest)
      '#e8ddd4',
      '#d4a5a5', // dustyRose

  defaultColorScheme: 'auto'
});

// In HTML head
<ColorSchemeScript defaultColorScheme="auto" />

// Provider setup
<MantineProvider theme={theme}>
  <App />
</MantineProvider>
```

### Hero Section Implementation

import { AppShell, NavLink, Avatar, Menu } from '@mantine/core';

const Navigation = () => {
  const { user, hasRole } = useAuth();
  
  return (
    <AppShell.Navbar p="md">
      <NavLink label="Events" leftSection={<CalendarIcon />} />
      
      {hasRole('member') && (
        <NavLink label="Member Dashboard" leftSection={<DashboardIcon />} />
      )}

## Design Direction Recommendations

### Visual Aesthetic Direction
1. **Color Evolution**: Expand WitchCityRope's current black/white palette with:
   - Deep burgundy (#880124) as primary brand color
   - Dusty rose (#d4a5a5) as accent color
   - Charcoal (#2c2c2c) as dark theme background
   - Ivory (#f8f4e6) as light theme background

2. **Typography Enhancement**: 
   - Maintain current clean aesthetic with modern font stacks
   - Use gradient text effects for key headings and brand elements
   - Implement responsive typography scaling (62px → 32px mobile)

3. **Component Modernization**:
   - Subtle hover animations and state changes
   - Clean card-based layouts for event listings
   - Progressive enhancement approach for advanced features

### Interaction Design Patterns
1. **Navigation**: Implement AppShell pattern with role-based menu sections
2. **Actions**: Use gradient buttons for primary CTAs, outline for secondary
3. **Feedback**: Toast notifications with theme-aware styling
4. **Loading**: Skeleton placeholders maintaining layout integrity

### Mobile-First Approach
1. **Touch Optimization**: 44px minimum touch targets throughout
2. **Performance**: Progressive enhancement with critical CSS inlined
3. **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios maintained in both themes
4. **Gesture Support**: Swipe navigation for event browsing on mobile

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Dark theme foundation and core component library
2. **Phase 2**: Navigation system with role-based access
3. **Phase 3**: Hero section and homepage modernization
4. **Phase 4**: Event listing and detailed page enhancements
5. **Phase 5**: Authentication flows and user management interfaces
