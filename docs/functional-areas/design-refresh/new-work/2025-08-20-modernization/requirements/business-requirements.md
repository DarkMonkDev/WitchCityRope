## Executive Summary

WitchCityRope requires a design system modernization to transform the current luxury aesthetic into a more modern, edgy, and interactive experience while preserving the excellent UX patterns that make the platform effective. This initiative will deliver 5 iterative design variations showing progression from current to modern, reorganize documentation to prevent duplicates, and provide implementation guidance for the React + TypeScript + Mantine v7 technology stack.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
The current design, while well-executed and user-friendly, needs evolution to better reflect the edgy, alternative nature of Salem's rope bondage community. Stakeholders have identified specific opportunities:
- Homepage and navigation system need modernization
- Interactive elements should be more "spicy" and engaging
- Current aesthetic could be more contemporary while maintaining luxury feel
- Documentation structure has duplication issues (homepage vs home-page) causing confusion

### Business Value
- **Enhanced Brand Alignment**: Better reflects the edgy, alternative community culture
- **Improved User Engagement**: More interactive and modern interface increases user satisfaction
- **Clearer Documentation**: Organized design system prevents future confusion and duplicates
- **Competitive Advantage**: Modern aesthetic differentiates from generic community platforms
- **Future-Proof Foundation**: Scalable design system supports platform growth

### Success Metrics
- **Performance**: Page load times <3 seconds, interaction responses <200ms
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained
- **Design Delivery**: 5 complete design variations delivered with stakeholder selection
- **Documentation Organization**: Zero duplicate design files after reorganization
- **UX Preservation**: All current navigation patterns and user flows maintained
- **Technical Feasibility**: All designs compatible with React + Mantine v7 components

## Target State Vision

### Design Evolution Goals
1. **Enhanced Edginess**: Push the alternative aesthetic further while maintaining elegance
2. **Modern Interactive Elements**: Subtle-to-moderate animations, advanced hover states, dynamic feedback
3. **Improved Color Sophistication**: Dark theme toggle in browser (not just dark-only), dramatic contrasts
4. **Mobile-First Design**: Contemporary responsive patterns optimized for touch
5. **Mantine v7 Leverage**: Advanced component capabilities, no custom components needed

### Scope Prioritization (Implementation Order)
1. **Homepage and Navigation** (FIRST PRIORITY - Immediate focus)
2. **Login Page** (Second priority)
3. **Events Page** (Third priority)
4. **Admin/User Dashboards** (Future phase - not in current scope)
5. **Additional Pages** (Future phases as needed)

### 5 Design Variation Strategy
1. **Variation 1**: Current + Enhanced Interactivity (subtle evolution)
2. **Variation 2**: Dark theme + improved contrasts (moderate change)
3. **Variation 3**: Modern Mantine patterns + enhanced typography (significant shift)
4. **Variation 4**: Advanced Mantine components + geometric elements (dramatic change)
5. **Variation 5**: Template-inspired + ultra-modern patterns (revolutionary approach)

### Documentation Reorganization Requirements
- **Global Design System**: `/docs/design/system/` - Core colors, typography, components
- **Functional Area Designs**: `/docs/functional-areas/{area}/design/` - Feature-specific designs
- **Archive Legacy**: Move duplicates to `/docs/_archive/design-legacy-{date}/`
- **Clear Naming**: Standardize file naming conventions (no homepage vs home-page confusion)

## User Personas and Design Needs

## Business Rules

### Design Evolution Rules
1. **UX Preservation**: All existing user flows and navigation patterns must be maintained
2. **Accessibility Compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards must be met or exceeded
3. **Brand Consistency**: Evolution must feel cohesive, not jarring transformation
4. **Performance Standards**: No design element should degrade page load times beyond 10%
5. **Mobile Compatibility**: All designs must be fully functional on 320px width screens

### Content Integration Rules
1. **Text Compatibility**: New typography must support all existing content lengths
2. **Image Standards**: Consistent aspect ratios and quality standards for community images
3. **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations must meet 4.5:1 contrast ratios minimum
4. **Interactive Standards**: All interactive elements must have clear focus and hover states
5. **Responsive Behavior**: Components must gracefully adapt across all screen sizes

### Implementation Rules
1. **Mantine Integration**: Leverage existing Mantine v7 components where possible
2. **CSS Architecture**: Follow established CSS module patterns in React components
3. **Asset Optimization**: All images and graphics must be optimized for web delivery
