# Final Design v6 - Minimal Fixes Applied

## The changes you requested:

### âœ… Icons - Back to refined-rope-flow animation
Used the EXACT animation that worked better:
```css
.feature:hover .feature-icon {
    border-radius: 20% 50% 20% 50%;
    transform: rotate(5deg) scale(1.1);
}
```

### âœ… Buttons - Removed the rise effect
- **REMOVED**: `translateY(-2px)` that caused the twisting look
- **KEPT**: The corner animation you said was "VERY close"
- Result: Clean corner morph without vertical movement

## ðŸ“‹ Your Final Design:

## What's Different from v4-fixed:

| Element | v4-fixed | v6 (NEW) |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Icons** | Push-pull corners | Original refined-rope-flow animation |
| **Buttons** | Corner animation + rise | Corner animation only (no rise) |

---

## Everything Else Unchanged:
- All colors from refined-original âœ“
- Navigation underline animations âœ“
- Witch City Rope title underline âœ“
- 3px nav border âœ“
- Footer color-only hover âœ“

---

**This should be very close to final - the buttons now morph corners without that twisting effect, and the icons use the better animation.**
