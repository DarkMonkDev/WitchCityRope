### Two Updated Versions:

1. **[Final Design v3](/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/functional-areas/design-refresh/new-work/2025-08-20-modernization/design/final-design/final-design-v3.html)**
   - Buttons rotate clockwise (1deg) on hover
   - Exact animation from refined-rope-flow

2. **[Final Design v4](/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/functional-areas/design-refresh/new-work/2025-08-20-modernization/design/final-design/final-design-v4.html)**
   - Buttons rotate counter-clockwise (-1deg) on hover
   - Same distortion, opposite direction

## üéØ What I Fixed

### Community Cards Animation (From refined-rope-flow)
```css
/* EXACT animation you liked */
.feature-icon:hover {
    border-radius: 20% 50% 20% 50%;
    transform: rotate(5deg) scale(1.1);
}
```
The cards now morph/distort their shape on hover - exactly as you saw before.

### Button Animation (Same effect applied)
```css
/* Similar distortion on buttons */
.btn:hover {
    border-radius: 8px 20px 8px 20px;
    transform: rotate(1deg) scale(1.02);
}
```
Buttons now distort with the same morphing effect.

### Navigation Border Line
- **Was**: 1px thick
- **Now**: 3px thick (as requested)

## üöÄ Next Steps

These versions have the correct animations from refined-rope-flow.html. The only difference between v3 and v4 is the button rotation direction (clockwise vs counter-clockwise).
