# API Architecture Modernization Progress

<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-22 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Backend Development Team -->
<!-- Status: Phase 1 - Requirements & Research -->

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Research and implement .NET 9 minimal API best practices with vertical slice architecture patterns to modernize our current API architecture.

**Scope**: 
- Research minimal API patterns and vertical slice architecture
- Analyze current API structure and identify modernization opportunities
- Design new architecture following .NET 9 best practices
- Create implementation plan for gradual migration
- Validate approach with proof of concept

**Success Criteria**:
- Comprehensive research on .NET 9 minimal API patterns
- Vertical slice architecture analysis and recommendations
- Modern API architecture design with clear migration path
- Proof of concept demonstrating key patterns
- Implementation roadmap with risk assessment
