## Validation Strategy

### How to Verify Agents Understand New Patterns

**Phase 1: Documentation Validation**
1. **Agent Startup Test**: Verify agents read required documentation
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Test agents can identify simple vs complex patterns
3. **Anti-pattern Detection**: Verify agents reject MediatR/CQRS suggestions

**Phase 2: Implementation Validation**
1. **Simple Feature Creation**: Ask agents to implement basic feature using new patterns
2. **Complexity Rejection**: Present complex architecture options - agents must choose simple
3. **Code Review Simulation**: Test agents can review and correct pattern violations

**Phase 3: Integration Validation**
1. **Multi-agent Coordination**: Test orchestrator + backend-developer coordination
2. **Cross-agent Consistency**: Verify all agents apply consistent patterns
3. **Long-term Monitoring**: Track pattern compliance over multiple development cycles

### Test Scenarios for Validation

**Scenario 1: Simple Feature Implementation**
- **Request**: "Create a new user profile update feature"
- **Expected**: Feature/UserProfile/ folder with Service, Endpoints, Models, Validation
- **Forbidden**: Any MediatR references or complex pipeline architecture

**Scenario 2: Architecture Choice Test**
- **Request**: "What architecture pattern should we use for command handling?"
- **Expected**: "Direct Entity Framework services with minimal API endpoints"
- **Forbidden**: "MediatR with CQRS pipeline" or complex architectural suggestions

**Scenario 3: Code Review Test**
- **Present**: Code with MediatR patterns
- **Expected**: Agent identifies violations and suggests simple service patterns
- **Forbidden**: Agent accepts or enhances MediatR complexity

### Rollback if Agents Create Old Patterns

**Detection Mechanisms**:
1. **Architecture Validator Agent**: Continuous pattern monitoring
2. **Code Review Integration**: Pattern violation detection in reviews
3. **Build Pipeline Checks**: Automated architecture compliance validation

**Rollback Procedures**:
1. **Immediate Pattern Correction**: Architecture validator identifies and flags violations
2. **Agent Re-training**: Update agent lessons learned with specific violation examples
3. **Pattern Library Updates**: Enhance anti-pattern detection with real violation examples
4. **Orchestrator Override**: Orchestrator can reject agent suggestions that violate patterns

**Escalation Process**:
1. **Level 1**: Architecture validator auto-correction
2. **Level 2**: Agent lessons learned update and retry
3. **Level 3**: Manual intervention and agent configuration review
