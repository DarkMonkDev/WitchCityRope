- **Timeline**: 5 weeks | **Effort**: 113 hours | **Confidence**: 65%

### Strategy 2: Full Vertical Slice Architecture ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
**Approach**: Complete migration to minimal APIs with feature-based CQRS organization
- **Pros**: Maximum performance benefits, excellent developer experience, future-proof architecture, superior testing
- **Cons**: High learning curve, implementation complexity, requires comprehensive training
- **Timeline**: 7 weeks | **Effort**: 288 hours | **Confidence**: 89%

### Strategy 3: Hybrid Pragmatic Approach
**Approach**: Minimal APIs with feature organization but without complex CQRS patterns
- **Pros**: Good performance benefits, balanced complexity, reasonable learning curve, evolution flexibility
- **Cons**: Less structured patterns, manual validation handling, potential architectural drift
- **Timeline**: 6 weeks | **Effort**: 190 hours | **Confidence**: 78%

## Critical Questions for Stakeholder

### Timeline Preferences
- [ ] **7-week timeline acceptable?** Full vertical slice provides maximum value but requires comprehensive approach
- [ ] **6-week alternative preferred?** Hybrid approach offers good benefits with moderate complexity
- [ ] **5-week minimum acceptable?** Conservative approach provides limited benefits with lowest risk

### Risk Tolerance and Investment
- [ ] **Training investment approved?** 16 hours per developer for CQRS/Vertical Slice patterns
- [ ] **Team resource allocation confirmed?** 75% developer time dedicated to migration during 7-week period
- [ ] **Architecture complexity tolerance?** Full vertical slice requires learning MediatR, FluentValidation, CQRS patterns

### Priority Clarification
- [ ] **Performance vs Simplicity?** Maximum mobile performance improvement vs minimal team disruption
- [ ] **Future-proofing vs Immediate delivery?** Industry-standard architecture vs quick modernization
- [ ] **Developer experience priority?** 40-60% productivity improvement vs gradual enhancement

### Coordination Requirements
- [ ] **Other teams' merge timeline?** Preference to wait for other teams' code integration before migration begins
- [ ] **Feature development balance?** How to prioritize migration work against new feature development (events management, payment integration)

## Risks and Concerns

### Major Risks Identified

**Learning Curve Risk (High Priority)**
- **Issue**: Team unfamiliarity with CQRS, MediatR, and Vertical Slice Architecture patterns
- **Impact**: Could slow initial development velocity and increase implementation errors
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive 16-hour training program with hands-on exercises and pair programming
- **Fallback**: Switch to Strategy 3 (Hybrid) if training assessment shows inadequate adoption

**Migration Complexity Risk (Medium Priority)**
- **Issue**: Restructuring existing controller-based endpoints requires systematic approach
- **Impact**: Potential for temporary instability or missed functionality during transition
- **Mitigation**: Feature-by-feature migration with parallel testing and gradual rollout
- **Fallback**: Maintain ability to rollback individual features to controller patterns

**Performance Validation Risk (Low Priority)**
- **Issue**: Actual performance improvements may not meet 15% target in production environment
- **Impact**: Business value proposition may not materialize as expected
- **Mitigation**: Continuous benchmarking throughout implementation with optimization sprints
- **Fallback**: Performance-focused optimization phase if targets not achieved

### Blocking Issues Assessment

**No Critical Blockers Identified** - All risks have clear mitigation strategies and fallback plans.

**Dependency Considerations**:
- React frontend integration requires no changes (API contracts preserved)
- NSwag type generation continues working identically with minimal APIs
- Database and authentication systems require no modifications
