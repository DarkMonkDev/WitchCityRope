# Business Requirements: API Architecture Modernization Initiative
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-22 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary

WitchCityRope's current controller-based API architecture requires modernization to align with .NET 9 minimal API patterns, improve developer productivity, and optimize performance for our mobile-first community members. This initiative will migrate from traditional MVC controllers to a vertical slice architecture using minimal APIs while maintaining all existing functionality and preserving our robust NSwag type generation workflow.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

**Developer Experience Challenges**:
1. **Boilerplate Overhead**: Current controller architecture requires 15-20 lines of ceremonial code per endpoint, slowing feature development
2. **Horizontal Coupling**: Controller → Service → Repository pattern creates cross-feature dependencies that complicate testing and maintenance
3. **Performance Gap**: 15% slower request processing and 93% higher memory usage compared to .NET 9 minimal API standards impacts mobile user experience
4. **Architecture Drift**: Using .NET 8 patterns in .NET 9 environment creates technical debt and reduces long-term maintainability

**Community Impact**: 
- Salem rope bondage community members primarily access the platform via mobile devices at events
- Performance improvements directly benefit user experience during event check-ins and real-time interactions
- Developer velocity improvements enable faster delivery of safety and educational features

## User Stories

### Story 1: Developer Productivity Enhancement
**As a** Backend Developer  
**I want to** create new API endpoints with minimal boilerplate code  
**So that** I can focus on business logic instead of ceremonial controller setup  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a new feature requirement
- When I implement the API endpoint using minimal API pattern
- Then I complete the endpoint in 3-5 lines vs 15-20 lines with controllers
- And the endpoint maintains full OpenAPI documentation
- And NSwag type generation works identically to current implementation

### Story 2: Feature Isolation and Testing
**As a** Backend Developer  
**I want to** organize API code by feature rather than technical layer  
**So that** I can test and modify features independently without cross-feature impact  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given a feature modification requirement
- When I update code in a feature slice
- Then only that feature's tests need to run for validation
- And no other features are affected by the change
- And test setup requires minimal mocking and dependencies

### Story 3: Mobile Performance Optimization
**As a** WitchCityRope Community Member using mobile device  
**I want to** experience fast API responses during event interactions  
**So that** I can quickly check into events and access information without delays  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I'm using the mobile interface at an event
- When I interact with API endpoints (authentication, event check-in, profile access)
- Then API responses complete in under 170ms average
- And mobile interactions feel responsive and immediate
- And event check-in process completes within 2-3 seconds total

### Story 4: Development Team Onboarding  
**As a** New Backend Developer joining the team  
**I want to** understand API code organization quickly  
**So that** I can contribute to feature development within my first week  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I'm reviewing the API codebase for the first time
- When I locate a specific feature (authentication, events, users)
- Then all related code (endpoint, validation, business logic) is in one location
- And I can understand the feature flow without navigating multiple directories
- And I can implement a similar feature following established patterns

### Story 5: Operational Monitoring and Documentation
**As an** Operations Team Member  
**I want to** maintain current monitoring and documentation capabilities  
**So that** API performance and functionality remain fully observable  

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given the modernized API architecture
- When I access API documentation and monitoring tools
- Then Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is comprehensive and accurate
- And health check endpoints provide same operational visibility
- And logging patterns remain consistent for troubleshooting
- And NSwag continues generating TypeScript types automatically

## Implementation Examples

### Current Controller Pattern Example
```csharp
// Current: Traditional Controller (18-20 lines per endpoint)
[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class AuthController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IAuthService _authService;
    private readonly ILogger<AuthController> _logger;

    [HttpPost("register")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> Register([FromBody] RegisterDto registerDto)
    {
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
            return BadRequest(ModelState);
            
        var (success, user, error) = await _authService.RegisterAsync(registerDto);
        
        if (success)
            return CreatedAtAction(nameof(GetUser), new { id = user.Id }, user);
            
        return BadRequest(error);
    }
}
```

### Target Minimal API Pattern Example
```csharp
// Target: Minimal API with Vertical Slice (3-5 lines per endpoint)
public class RegisterEndpoint : IEndpoint
{
    public void MapEndpoint(IEndpointRouteBuilder app)
    {
        app.MapPost("/api/auth/register", async (
            RegisterCommand command, 
            IMediator mediator) =>
            await mediator.Send(command) switch
            {
                var (success, user, _) when success => Results.Created($"/api/auth/user/{user.Id}", user),
                var (_, _, error) => Results.BadRequest(error)
            })
            .WithName("Register")
            .WithSummary("Register new user account")
            .WithTags("Authentication")
            .Produces<UserDto>(201)
            .ProducesValidationProblem();
    }
}
```
