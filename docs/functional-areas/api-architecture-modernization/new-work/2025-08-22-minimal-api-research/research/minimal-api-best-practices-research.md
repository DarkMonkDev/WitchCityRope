#### Phase 3: Feature Implementation Pattern (Weeks 3-6)
```csharp
// Example: Features/Events/CreateEvent/CreateEventCommand.cs
public record CreateEventCommand(
    string Title,
    string Description,
    DateTime StartDate,
    DateTime EndDate,
    decimal Price,
    int MaxAttendees
) : IRequest<Result<EventDto>>;

// CreateEventCommandHandler.cs
public class CreateEventCommandHandler : IRequestHandler<CreateEventCommand, Result<EventDto>>
{
    private readonly IEventRepository _repository;
    private readonly IMapper _mapper;

    public CreateEventCommandHandler(IEventRepository repository, IMapper mapper)
    {
        _repository = repository;
        _mapper = mapper;
    }

    public async Task<Result<EventDto>> Handle(CreateEventCommand request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        var eventEntity = new Event
        {
            Title = request.Title,
            Description = request.Description,
            StartDate = request.StartDate,
            EndDate = request.EndDate,
            Price = request.Price,
            MaxAttendees = request.MaxAttendees,
            CreatedAt = DateTime.UtcNow
        };

        await _repository.AddAsync(eventEntity);
        var dto = _mapper.Map<EventDto>(eventEntity);
        
        return Result<EventDto>.Success(dto);
    }
}

// CreateEventValidator.cs
public class CreateEventValidator : AbstractValidator<CreateEventCommand>
{
    public CreateEventValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.Title)
            .NotEmpty()
            .MaximumLength(200);
            
        RuleFor(x => x.StartDate)
            .GreaterThan(DateTime.UtcNow)
            .WithMessage("Event must start in the future");
            
        RuleFor(x => x.EndDate)
            .GreaterThan(x => x.StartDate)
            .WithMessage("End date must be after start date");
    }
}

// CreateEventEndpoint.cs
public class CreateEventEndpoint : IEndpoint
{
    public void MapEndpoint(IEndpointRouteBuilder app)
    {
        app.MapPost("/api/events", async (
            CreateEventCommand command,
            IMediator mediator,
            CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
        {
            var result = await mediator.Send(command, cancellationToken);
            return result.IsSuccess 
                ? Results.Created($"/api/events/{result.Value.Id}", result.Value)
                : Results.BadRequest(result.Error);
        })
        .WithName("CreateEvent")
        .WithSummary("Create a new event")
        .WithDescription("Creates a new event with the provided details")
        .WithTags("Events")
        .Produces<EventDto>(201)
        .ProducesValidationProblem();
    }
}

// Automatic Registration Extension
public static class EndpointExtensions
{
    public static void MapEndpoints(this WebApplication app)
    {
        var endpointTypes = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()
            .GetTypes()
            .Where(t => t.IsAssignableTo(typeof(IEndpoint)) && !t.IsAbstract);

        foreach (var type in endpointTypes)
        {
            var endpoint = (IEndpoint)Activator.CreateInstance(type)!;
            endpoint.MapEndpoint(app);
        }
    }
}
```

### Integration Points
- **NSwag Compatibility**: Minimal APIs generate excellent OpenAPI specifications for TypeScript type generation
- **Authentication**: JWT middleware works seamlessly with minimal API endpoints
- **Validation**: FluentValidation integrates through MediatR pipeline behaviors
- **Error Handling**: Global error handling middleware processes exceptions from all endpoints
- **Logging**: Structured logging works identically with minimal APIs

### Performance Impact
- **Bundle Size Impact**: Minimal APIs reduce assembly size by ~15-20KB through reduced controller scaffolding
- **Runtime Performance**: 15% faster request processing, 93% less memory allocation vs controllers
- **Memory Usage**: Significantly reduced allocations per request (~1.18MB vs 2.13MB for controllers)
- **Throughput**: Higher requests per second capacity in .NET 9

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Team Learning Curve**: Team unfamiliarity with CQRS, MediatR, and Vertical Slice Architecture
  - **Mitigation**: 
    - Conduct 2-week training program on patterns and libraries
    - Start with simple features (authentication, basic CRUD)
    - Implement pair programming for first month
    - Create internal documentation and code examples

### Medium Risk
- **Migration Complexity**: Restructuring existing controller-based endpoints
  - **Mitigation**: 
    - Implement gradual migration starting with new features
    - Run parallel implementations during transition period
    - Maintain comprehensive test coverage during migration
    - Use feature flags to control rollout

### Low Risk
- **NSwag Integration**: Potential changes required in type generation configuration
  - **Monitoring**: Test OpenAPI generation after each feature migration
  - **Fallback**: Maintain current controller-based endpoints for critical paths until validation complete

## Recommendation
