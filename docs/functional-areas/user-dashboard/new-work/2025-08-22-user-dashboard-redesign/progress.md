# User Dashboard Redesign Progress - 2025-08-22
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-22 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: UI/React Teams -->
<!-- Status: Active -->

## Overview

Comprehensive user dashboard redesign project migrating from Blazor Server to React with Design System v7. This project focuses on creating a modern, intuitive dashboard with left-hand navigation menu displaying user's RSVP'd and purchased upcoming events.

## Project Scope

### Primary Objectives
- Redesign left-hand menu with 5 key sections (Dashboard, Events, Profile, Security, Membership)
- Focus on displaying user's RSVP'd/purchased upcoming events prominently
- Maintain consistency with main site navigation patterns
- Implement using Design System v7 standards
- Use small incremental development steps following approved workflow

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **UI Framework**: Mantine v7 (per ADR-004)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query v5 + Zustand
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **Type Generation**: NSwag (@witchcityrope/shared-types)
- **Styling**: Design System v7 tokens and components

## Human Review Points

### Mandatory Reviews
1. **After Phase 1**: Business requirements and technical architecture review
2. **After Phase 2**: UI design and component architecture approval
3. **After Phase 4**: User acceptance testing and production readiness

### Review Criteria
- Alignment with Design System v7 standards
- Consistency with authentication patterns established
- Integration with existing React architecture
- Performance and accessibility compliance
- User experience quality

## Success Criteria

### Technical Success
- Dashboard loads in <1.5 seconds
- 100% type safety with NSwag generated types
- Mobile-responsive design across all breakpoints
- Zero accessibility violations (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Integration with existing authentication system

### Business Success
- Users can easily access RSVP'd/purchased events
- Navigation matches main site patterns
- Improves user engagement with event features
- Reduces support requests for event access
- Enhances overall user experience

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Integration**: Leverage proven TanStack Query patterns from authentication
- **State Management**: Use established Zustand patterns
- **Design Consistency**: Strict adherence to Design System v7
- **Performance**: Early performance testing and optimization

### Process Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Small incremental steps with clear phase boundaries
- **Design Drift**: Mandatory design review points
- **Technical Debt**: Code review requirements in each phase
- **Integration Issues**: Early integration testing with existing systems
