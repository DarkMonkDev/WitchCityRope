# Business Requirements: User Dashboard Redesign (CONSOLIDATED)
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-10-08 -->
<!-- Version: 4.0 - CONSOLIDATION UPDATE: Simplified Two-Page Structure -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Consolidated -->

## ðŸš¨ CONSOLIDATION UPDATE ðŸš¨

**Major simplification based on October 2025 stakeholder feedback:**
- **REMOVED**: Right-side menu/status area entirely
- **TWO PRIMARY PAGES**: Dashboard Landing (`/dashboard`) + Events Page (`/dashboard/events`)
- **Dashboard Landing**: Welcome message, upcoming events (3-5 cards), quick shortcuts
- **Events Page**: Full event history with tabs (Upcoming/Past/Cancelled)
- **Integration**: Uses existing EventDetailPage for event actions
- **Maintained**: Edge-to-edge layout, left nav, simple functionality focus

This is a **simple website with simple functionality** - not complex design.

## Architecture Discovery Results

### Documents Reviewed:
- **domain-layer-architecture.md**: Lines 725-997 - Found complete NSwag implementation for TypeScript type generation
- **DTO-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md**: Lines 85-213 - Confirmed API as source of truth, NSwag auto-generation requirement
- **migration-plan.md**: Lines 1-100 - Found React infrastructure status (complete) and Mantine v7 selection
- **functional-area-master-index.md**: User Dashboard area exists with current active work path identified
- **business-requirements-lessons-learned.md**: Critical validation requirements for DTO specification standards

### Legacy Wireframes Reviewed:
- **user-dashboard-visual.html**: Main dashboard layout with prominent event display and welcome section
- **member-security-settings-visual.html**: Security settings with sidebar navigation showing Profile/Membership/Security/Notifications structure
- **member-my-tickets-visual.html**: Events page with filter tabs for Upcoming/Past/Cancelled events
- **member-profile-settings-visual.html**: Profile editing interface with sidebar navigation
- **member-membership-settings.html**: Membership status and management interface
- **user-menu-wireframes.md**: Complete navigation patterns for authenticated and unauthenticated states

### Existing Solutions Found:
- **NSwag Type Generation**: Complete TypeScript interface generation from C# DTOs (lines 725-774)
- **Authentication System**: Complete React implementation (Milestone achieved 2025-08-19)
- **UI Framework**: Mantine v7 validated and integrated (ADR-004, Infrastructure complete 2025-08-18)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query v5 + Zustand patterns proven in authentication milestone
- **Design System v7**: Integrated on homepage with Mantine v7 components
- **EventDetailPage**: Existing event detail page with action buttons (View Details integration point)

### Verification Statement:
Confirmed existing solutions for all technical foundations. No manual DTO creation required - NSwag generates all TypeScript types. React infrastructure and design systems are production-ready. Legacy wireframes provide general direction - creating simplified version, not exact copies. EventDetailPage already exists for event detail actions.

## Executive Summary

The User Dashboard Redesign project creates a **simple, two-page dashboard** replacing the legacy Blazor Server implementation. The dashboard features a **left-mounted menu** with 5 sections (Dashboard, Events, Profile, Security, Membership) and **edge-to-edge layout**. The **Dashboard Landing page** (`/dashboard`) shows a welcome message and upcoming events preview (3-5 cards max) with quick shortcuts. The **Events Page** (`/dashboard/events`) provides full event history with tabs for filtering. All event actions navigate to the existing EventDetailPage. The primary focus is **functionality over complex design**.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

The current Blazor Server dashboard needs a simple React implementation with clear separation between dashboard overview and event management. Users need quick access to upcoming events on their dashboard landing while maintaining full event history access on a dedicated events page. **Previous designs had too many elements** - this consolidation creates two focused pages: a welcoming dashboard with preview, and a comprehensive events page for history.

### Business Value

- **Clear Purpose Separation**: Dashboard for overview, Events page for history
- **Reduced Clutter**: Dashboard shows only 3-5 upcoming events, not full list
- **Quick Navigation**: Shortcuts on dashboard for common actions
- **Comprehensive History**: Dedicated events page with all participation data
- **Existing Integration**: Uses EventDetailPage for event actions (proven pattern)
- **Simple Design**: Edge-to-edge layout, no right-side menu, clean interface

### Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Dashboard load time <1.5 seconds, Events page <2 seconds
- **Usability**: Users find upcoming events immediately on dashboard
- **Navigation**: <2 clicks to reach any event detail or account setting
- **Simplicity**: Zero UI complexity complaints
- **Functionality**: All event history accessible via tabs
- **Mobile Usage**: Clean responsive experience on all devices
