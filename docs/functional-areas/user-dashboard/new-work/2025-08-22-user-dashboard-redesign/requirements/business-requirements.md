<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-22 -->
<!-- Version: 3.0 - CRITICAL SIMPLIFICATION UPDATE -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Simplified -->

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SIMPLIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ðŸš¨

Based on stakeholder feedback, this is a **simple website with simple functionality**. The previous requirements were over-engineered for our needs.

### Key Simplification Principles:
- **REMOVE**: Multiple layers, floating boxes, redundant elements
- **REMOVE**: Complex UI patterns and overcomplications
- **FOCUS**: Edge-to-edge layout like main website
- **PRIORITY**: Get functionality working correctly, not complex design
- **FUTURE**: May redesign later - don't over-engineer now

## Architecture Discovery Results

### Documents Reviewed:
- **domain-layer-architecture.md**: Lines 725-997 - Found complete NSwag implementation for TypeScript type generation
- **DTO-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md**: Lines 85-213 - Confirmed API as source of truth, NSwag auto-generation requirement  
- **migration-plan.md**: Lines 1-100 - Found React infrastructure status (complete) and Mantine v7 selection
- **functional-area-master-index.md**: User Dashboard area exists with current active work path identified
- **business-requirements-lessons-learned.md**: Critical validation requirements for DTO specification standards

### Legacy Wireframes Reviewed:
- **user-dashboard-visual.html**: Main dashboard layout with prominent event display and welcome section
- **member-security-settings-visual.html**: Security settings with sidebar navigation showing Profile/Membership/Security/Notifications structure
- **member-my-tickets-visual.html**: Events page with filter tabs for Upcoming/Past/Cancelled events
- **member-profile-settings-visual.html**: Profile editing interface with sidebar navigation
- **member-membership-settings.html**: Membership status and management interface
- **user-menu-wireframes.md**: Complete navigation patterns for authenticated and unauthenticated states

### Existing Solutions Found:
- **NSwag Type Generation**: Complete TypeScript interface generation from C# DTOs (lines 725-774)
- **Authentication System**: Complete React implementation (Milestone achieved 2025-08-19)
- **UI Framework**: Mantine v7 validated and integrated (ADR-004, Infrastructure complete 2025-08-18)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query v5 + Zustand patterns proven in authentication milestone
- **Design System v7**: Integrated on homepage with Mantine v7 components

### Verification Statement:
Confirmed existing solutions for all technical foundations. No manual DTO creation required - NSwag generates all TypeScript types. React infrastructure and design systems are production-ready. Legacy wireframes provide general direction - creating simplified version, not exact copies.

## Executive Summary

The User Dashboard Redesign project will create a **simple, clean dashboard** replacing the legacy Blazor Server implementation. The dashboard features a **left-mounted menu** with 5 sections (Dashboard, Events, Profile, Security, Membership) and **edge-to-edge layout** extending across the entire page. The primary focus is **functionality over complex design**, showing users their upcoming RSVP'd events without unnecessary UI complications.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

The current Blazor Server dashboard needs to be replaced with a simple React implementation. Users need straightforward access to their upcoming events and basic account functions. **Previous requirements were too complex** - this is a simple website that should focus on getting the correct functionality and navigation working without floating boxes, layers, or overcomplicated UI patterns.

### Business Value

- **Simplified Navigation**: Clear 5-section menu without complexity
- **Direct Event Access**: Show user's actual events without extra layers
- **Clean Design**: Edge-to-edge layout like main website
- **Functional Focus**: Working features over visual complexity
- **Future-Ready**: Simple foundation that can be enhanced later

### Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Dashboard load time <1.5 seconds
- **Usability**: Users can complete tasks without confusion
- **Simplicity**: Zero UI complexity complaints
- **Functionality**: All basic features work correctly
- **Mobile Usage**: Clean mobile experience
