## Executive Summary

The User Dashboard Redesign project creates a **simple, two-page dashboard** aligned with the **approved wireframe v4 iteration**. The dashboard features:

- **My Events Page** (`/dashboard`): User's registered events with conditional vetting alert, "Show Past Events" toggle, and grid/table view options
- **Profile Settings Page** (`/dashboard/profile-settings`): Consolidated profile editing with tabbed structure (Personal, Social, Security, Vetting)
- **Edit Profile Access**: Available via top utility bar (before Logout) and dashboard page title bar button
- **Vetting Status Alert**: Conditional display for Pending, Approved, On Hold, Denied statuses (hidden when Vetted)
- **User-Focused Event Display**: Shows only user's registered events with status badges (NO pricing, capacity, or sales elements)
- **Simplified Filtering**: "Show Past Events" checkbox (unchecked by default) instead of complex tab navigation
- **View Toggle**: Switch between Card View (grid) and List View (table)

The design prioritizes **functionality over complex design** and focuses on the user's registered events and profile management.

---

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

Users need a clean dashboard that shows their registered events and allows easy profile management. The dashboard must be a **user dashboard** (not a public sales page), focusing on events the user has already committed to. Users need quick access to profile editing from multiple entry points. Non-vetted users need clear visibility of their vetting status with appropriate next steps.

### Business Value

- **User-Focused Design**: Shows only user's events, not sales-focused public event listings
- **Clear Vetting Visibility**: Conditional alert box provides status-specific guidance
- **Quick Profile Access**: "Edit Profile" available in utility bar and dashboard title bar
- **Simplified Event Filtering**: Single checkbox for past events instead of complex tabs
- **Flexible Views**: Grid (cards) and Table (list) views for different user preferences
- **Mobile Optimized**: Clean responsive experience on all devices
- **Status Clarity**: Clear badges for RSVP Confirmed, Ticket Purchased, Attended
- **Action Buttons**: "View Details" (not "Learn More") aligns with registered event context

### Success Metrics

- **Dashboard Load Time**: Page loads in <2 seconds
- **Profile Access**: "Edit Profile" click-through rate from dashboard >30%
- **Vetting Alert Engagement**: Users with non-vetted status engage with alert CTAs
- **View Toggle Usage**: Users switch between grid/table views based on preference
- **Past Events Filter**: "Show Past Events" toggle usage indicates historical event interest
- **Mobile Usage**: >50% of dashboard access from mobile devices with positive experience
- **Event Detail Navigation**: "View Details" click-through rate from event cards

- **Conditional Alert**: Vetting alert displayed based on status
- **Filter Controls**: Single filter bar with checkbox, view toggle, search
- **No Cancelled Section**: Cancelled events not displayed separately
