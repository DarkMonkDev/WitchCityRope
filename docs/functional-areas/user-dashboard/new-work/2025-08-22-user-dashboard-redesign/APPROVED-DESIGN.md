<!-- Last Updated: 2025-10-09 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: UI Design Team -->
<!-- Status: APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION -->

## üéØ APPROVAL STATUS

**Date Approved**: October 9, 2025
**Approved Wireframe**: `dashboard-wireframe-v4-iteration.html`
**Status**: ‚úÖ **APPROVED FOR IMPLEMENTATION**
**Approval Authority**: Project Owner

---

## üìã EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document serves as the **single source of truth** for all implementation work on the User Dashboard redesign. The v4 iteration wireframe has been approved as the final design, and all development work MUST match this specification exactly.

**Key Design Philosophy**: This is a **user dashboard** (not a public sales page). It focuses on the user's registered events and profile management with a clean, modern interface.

---

## üé® DESIGN SUMMARY

### Core Structure
- **2-Tab Layout**:
  - **My Events** (default tab) - User's registered events
  - **Profile Settings** (secondary tab) - User profile management

### Conditional Elements
- **Vetting Status Alert Box**: Shows only for non-vetted users (4 status types)
- **Past Events**: Hidden by default with checkbox toggle to show
- **View Toggle**: Grid (card) view and Table (list) view options

### Navigation Updates
- **Top Utility Bar**: Added "Edit Profile" link (before Logout)
- **Dashboard Title**: Displays as "[User's Name] Dashboard" (e.g., "ShadowKnot Dashboard")
- **Edit Profile Button**: Appears on dashboard page for quick access

---

## üîë KEY FEATURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### 1. Navigation Enhancement
**Requirements**:
- Add "Edit Profile" link to utility bar (positioned before "Logout")
- Link should navigate to Profile Settings tab
- Maintain existing About, Contact, and Logout links
- Visual consistency with existing navigation styling

**Implementation Notes**:
```html
<!-- Utility Bar Structure -->
<a href="#">About</a>
<a href="#">Contact</a>
<a href="#profile">Edit Profile</a> <!-- NEW -->
<a href="#logout">Logout</a>
```

### 2. Page Title and Profile Access
**Requirements**:
- Title format: `{FirstName} Dashboard` (e.g., "ShadowKnot Dashboard")
- "Edit Profile" button positioned to the right of the title
- Button uses secondary button styling (cream background, rose-gold border)

**Data Binding**:
```typescript
// Get user's first name from auth context
const { user } = useAuth();
const dashboardTitle = `${user.firstName} Dashboard`;
```

### 3. Vetting Status Alert Box
**Requirements**:
- Display conditionally based on vetting status
- **Show for**: Pending, Approved, On Hold, Denied
- **Hide for**: Vetted (no alert needed)

**Alert Variants**:

| Status | Icon | Color | Title | Message |
|--------|------|-------|-------|---------|
| **Pending** | ‚è∞ | Blue (#2196F3) | "Application Under Review" | "Your membership application is currently under review. We'll notify you via email once it's been reviewed." |
| **Approved** | ‚úÖ | Green (#4CAF50) | "Great News! Your Application Has Been Approved" | "Schedule your vetting interview here to complete your membership." (with link) |
| **On Hold** | ‚è∏Ô∏è | Amber (#FFC107) | "Membership On Hold" | "Your membership is currently on hold. Contact us if you'd like to resume your membership." |
| **Denied** | ‚ùå | Red (#F44336) | "Application Not Approved" | "Your membership application was not approved at this time. Learn about reapplying." (with link) |

**Component Logic**:
```typescript
// Only render if NOT vetted
{vettingStatus !== 'Vetted' && (
  <VettingAlert status={vettingStatus} />
)}
```

### 4. Event Display - Grid View (Cards)
**Requirements**:
- Display user's registered events ONLY
- No pricing or capacity information (this is NOT a sales page)
- "View Details" button (NOT "Learn More")
- Status badges show registration state

**Event Card Structure**:
- **Header**: Gradient background with event title
- **Date/Time**: Formatted as "Day, Month Date ‚Ä¢ Time"
- **Location**: With location pin emoji
- **Status Badge**: Based on registration state
- **Action Button**: "View Details" (secondary styling)

**Status Badges**:
- **RSVP Confirmed** (Blue) - For social events with RSVP
- **Ticket Purchased** (Green) - For paid classes
- **Ticket Purchased (Social Event)** (Green) - For social events with tickets
- **Attended** (Purple) - For past events (when shown)

**Critical Implementation Notes**:
- ‚ùå **Remove**: Pricing, capacity, "spots available", "Learn More" buttons
- ‚úÖ **Use**: "View Details" button for all events
- ‚úÖ **Show**: Only events the user has registered for
- ‚úÖ **Hide**: Public sales elements completely

### 5. Event Display - Table View (List)
**Requirements**:
- Same data as grid view, different layout
- Columns: Date, Time, Title, Status, Action
- Sortable by date (with sort indicator)
- Clickable rows navigate to event details

**Table Structure**:
```
| Date    | Time    | Event Title                    | Status          | Action       |
|---------|---------|--------------------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Oct 31  | 7:00 PM | Halloween Rope Social          | RSVP Confirmed  | View Details |
| Nov 8   | 2:00 PM | Single Column Ties Workshop    | Ticket Purchased| View Details |
```

**Styling**:
- Header: Burgundy background (#880124), white text
- Rows: Alternate cream/white backgrounds
- Hover: Light burgundy background
- Status badges: Same as grid view

### 6. Filter and View Controls
**Requirements**:
- **Show Past Events**: Checkbox (unchecked by default)
- **View Toggle**: Card View (default) / List View buttons
- **Search Input**: Filter events by title/date
- All controls in single filter bar

**Behavior**:
- Past events hidden initially (`.hidden` class)
- Checkbox toggle shows/hides past events
- View toggle switches between grid and table
- Search filters visible events in real-time

### 7. Past Events Handling
**Requirements**:
- Past events have `.past-event` class
- Hidden by default with `.hidden` class
- "Show Past Events" checkbox controls visibility
- Past events show "Attended" status badge
- No separate "Cancelled Events" section

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Toggle past events visibility
const togglePastEvents = (show: boolean) => {
  document.querySelectorAll('.past-event').forEach(event => {
    event.classList.toggle('hidden', !show);
  });
};
```

## üö® CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### What to REMOVE (Sales Elements)
These elements exist in the public Events page but MUST NOT appear in the user dashboard:

‚ùå **Remove Completely**:
- Event pricing (`$45`, `Free`, etc.)
- Capacity information (`12 spots available`)
- "Learn More" buttons
- "Register Now" buttons
- Availability status (these are already registered)
- Sales-focused messaging

### What to USE Instead
‚úÖ **User Dashboard Elements**:
- "View Details" button (replaces "Learn More")
- Registration status badges (replaces pricing)
- User's events only (replaces all available events)
- Focus on event information, not sales

### Data Requirements
**User Dashboard Shows**:
- Events where `user.id` exists in registrations/tickets
- Registration status from database
- Event details (title, date, time, location)
- Vetting status from user profile

**API Endpoints Needed**:
```
GET /api/users/{userId}/events           # User's registered events
GET /api/users/{userId}/vetting-status   # Vetting alert display
GET /api/events/{eventId}                # Event details (for View Details)
```
