<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-19 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary
This technical validation project establishes proven API integration patterns using TanStack Query (React Query) with our .NET API backend before proceeding with full feature development. The validation ensures robust data fetching, caching, error handling, and optimistic update patterns that will be used across all WitchCityRope React features.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Phase 1.5 of our React migration (per migration plan) requires validation of critical technical patterns before full feature development. While our vertical slice projects proved basic fetch operations work, we need to establish production-ready patterns for:
- Sophisticated caching strategies with cache invalidation
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Optimistic updates for responsive user experience
- Background refetching for data freshness
- TypeScript typing for API responses
- Request/response interceptors for authentication

### Business Value
- **Risk Mitigation**: Validates technical feasibility before major development investment
- **Development Velocity**: Establishes reusable patterns that accelerate future feature development
- **User Experience**: Ensures responsive, offline-capable interactions
- **Code Quality**: Creates standardized patterns for consistent implementation
- **Technical Confidence**: Provides team confidence in chosen technology stack

### Success Metrics
- All 8 API integration patterns successfully validated with working code
- Performance targets achieved (sub-100ms perceived latency for user actions)
- Clear documentation and examples for all patterns
- Team confidence level >90% in technical approach
- Zero critical technical blockers identified

## What is TanStack Query and Why We Need It

### TanStack Query Overview
TanStack Query (formerly React Query) is a data fetching library that provides:
- **Intelligent Caching**: Automatic background updates and cache management
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with rollback on failure
- **Error Handling**: Built-in retry logic and error boundaries
- **Background Refetching**: Keeps data fresh without user interaction
- **Request Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate API calls
- **Offline Support**: Works with cached data when offline

### Why WitchCityRope Needs It
- **Community Events**: Real-time registration counts and availability updates
- **Member Management**: Optimistic updates for profile changes and status updates
- **Vetting System**: Background updates for application status changes
- **Payment Processing**: Reliable handling of payment state with retry logic
- **Real-time Features**: Integration with WebSocket updates for live events

## User Stories

### Story 1: Data Fetching Foundation
**As a** React developer
**I want to** use standardized data fetching patterns
**So that** all API interactions are consistent and reliable

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a .NET API endpoint
- When making a GET request using TanStack Query
- Then data is fetched, cached, and automatically typed
- And loading states are managed automatically
- And errors are handled gracefully with retry logic

### Story 2: Optimistic Updates
**As a** member updating their profile
**I want to** see changes immediately
**So that** the interface feels responsive

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given a profile update form
- When submitting changes
- Then the UI updates immediately (optimistic)
- And if the API call fails, changes roll back
- And appropriate error messages are shown

### Story 3: Background Data Freshness
**As a** user viewing event registrations
**I want to** see current availability
**So that** I don't try to register for full events

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given an event list page
- When the page is active
- Then registration data refreshes in background
- And UI updates when data changes
- And no loading spinners interrupt the experience

### Story 4: Cache Management
**As a** system administrator
**I want** efficient data caching
**So that** the platform performs well under load

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given frequently accessed data (events, member lists)
- When data is requested multiple times
- Then API calls are minimized through caching
- And cache invalidation works when data changes
- And stale data never persists beyond configured time

## Specific Patterns to Validate

### 1. Basic CRUD Operations
**Pattern**: Standard Create, Read, Update, Delete with TanStack Query
**Validation Requirements**:
```typescript
// Must validate these hooks work correctly:
- useQuery for data fetching
- useMutation for create/update/delete
- useQueryClient for cache management
- Proper TypeScript typing for all operations
```

### 2. Optimistic Updates
**Pattern**: Immediate UI updates with rollback capability
**Validation Requirements**:
- Profile updates show immediately
- Event registration updates capacity instantly
- Status changes reflect in UI before API confirmation
- Automatic rollback on API failure
- Clear error messaging for failed operations

### 3. Cache Invalidation Strategies
**Pattern**: Smart cache updates when data changes
**Validation Requirements**:
- Related query invalidation (user update invalidates user list)
- Selective cache updates (single item updates without full refetch)
- Time-based cache expiration
- Manual cache clearing for admin operations

### 4. Error Handling and Retry Logic
**Pattern**: Graceful degradation with automatic recovery
**Validation Requirements**:
- Network failure handling with exponential backoff retry
- Authentication error handling (token refresh)
- API error mapping to user-friendly messages
- Offline state management
- Error boundary integration

### 5. Pagination and Infinite Scroll
**Pattern**: Efficient large dataset handling
**Validation Requirements**:
- useInfiniteQuery for member lists and event history
- Virtual scrolling for performance
- Search and filter integration
- Loading states for pagination
- Proper memory management

### 6. Real-time Data Integration
**Pattern**: WebSocket updates integrated with cache
**Validation Requirements**:
- WebSocket events update TanStack Query cache
- Automatic UI updates when server pushes changes
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous updates
- Connection state management

### 7. Request/Response Interceptors
**Pattern**: Global request handling for auth and logging
**Validation Requirements**:
- Automatic JWT token attachment
- Request logging for debugging
- Response error handling
- Token refresh on 401 errors

### 8. TypeScript Integration
**Pattern**: Full type safety for API interactions
**Validation Requirements**:
- Generated types from API schema
- Type-safe query hooks
- Inference for mutation parameters
- Error type definitions

## Performance Requirements

### Response Time Targets
- **Initial Data Load**: <500ms for cached data
- **Optimistic Updates**: <50ms UI response time
- **Background Refetch**: <2 seconds for data freshness
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: >90% for frequently accessed data

### Resource Utilization
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB additional for query cache
- **Network Requests**: 60% reduction through caching
- **Bundle Size**: <30KB additional for TanStack Query

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Event Registration Flow
```typescript
// Validate this complete flow works:
1. Load event details (useQuery)
2. Register for event (useMutation with optimistic update)
3. Update available spots immediately
4. Handle payment processing
5. Refresh related queries (user's events, event attendees)
6. Show confirmation with error rollback if needed
```

### Use Case 2: Member Directory Management
```typescript
// Validate this admin workflow:
1. Load paginated member list (useInfiniteQuery)
2. Filter by vetting status (query key variation)
3. Update member status (optimistic mutation)
4. Refresh member counts in sidebar
5. Handle bulk operations efficiently
```

### Use Case 3: Real-time Event Updates
```typescript
// Validate this live update flow:
1. Subscribe to event WebSocket channel
2. Receive registration update from server
3. Update TanStack Query cache automatically
4. UI reflects new registration count
5. Handle conflicts with local optimistic updates
```

## Business Rules

### Caching Rules
1. **Event Data**: Cache for 5 minutes, invalidate on updates
2. **Member Data**: Cache for 15 minutes, invalidate on profile changes
3. **Payment Status**: Never cache, always fetch fresh
4. **Static Content**: Cache for 1 hour, manual invalidation only

### Error Handling Rules
1. **Network Errors**: Auto-retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
2. **Authentication Errors**: Attempt token refresh, redirect to login if failed
3. **Validation Errors**: Show field-specific messages, no retry
4. **Server Errors**: Show generic message, log for debugging

### Update Strategies
1. **Critical Data** (payments, vetting): No optimistic updates
2. **User Profile**: Optimistic updates with rollback
3. **Event Registration**: Optimistic with immediate capacity updates
4. **Admin Actions**: Confirmation required, no optimistic updates

## Security & Privacy Requirements

### Data Protection
- Sensitive data (payment info, private details) never cached
- Cache cleared on logout
- No personal data in query keys
- Secure token handling in interceptors

### Access Control
- Role-based query hooks (useAdminQuery, useVettedQuery)
- Automatic authorization header injection
- Graceful handling of permission changes
- Cache invalidation on role changes
