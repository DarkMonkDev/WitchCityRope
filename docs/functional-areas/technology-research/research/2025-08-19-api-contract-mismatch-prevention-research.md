## Implementation Considerations

### Migration Path
**Phase 1: Immediate (Week 1)**
- Implement enhanced agent workflow validation gates
- Add mandatory API endpoint discovery phase to orchestrator
- Create validation agent for API assumption checking

**Phase 2: Short-term (Weeks 2-4)**
- Enhance contract-first development documentation
- Add automated contract validation to CI/CD pipeline
- Implement breaking change detection for API modifications

**Phase 3: Long-term (Months 2-6)**
- Evaluate API gateway implementation for runtime validation
- Consider schema validation middleware for additional protection
- Implement comprehensive API lifecycle management

### Integration Points
**Current NSwag Implementation**: Enhanced validation builds on existing successful pattern
**Orchestrator System**: Natural extension of current agent workflow
**CI/CD Pipeline**: Integration with existing build processes
**Documentation System**: Leverages current architecture discovery process

### Performance Impact
**Bundle Size**: Minimal impact - validation logic only
**Runtime Performance**: No performance degradation for successful validation
**Development Workflow**: Slight increase in discovery time, significant reduction in debugging

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
**Agent Non-Compliance**: Agents bypass validation requirements
- **Mitigation**: Make validation gates mandatory in orchestrator, cannot proceed without completion

### Medium Risk
**False Positives**: Validation incorrectly flags valid scenarios
- **Mitigation**: Clear escalation process to architecture review board for exceptions

### Low Risk
**Performance Impact**: Additional validation steps slow development
- **Monitoring**: Track validation time and optimize discovery process as needed

## Recommendation

```typescript
// Proposed agent workflow enhancement
interface ApiDiscoveryGate {
  mustCheckExistingEndpoints: boolean;
  mustValidateNSwagGeneration: boolean;
  mustDocumentFindings: boolean;
  cannotProceedWithoutApproval: boolean;
}
```

#### 2. Automatic Red Flag Detection
- **Keywords**: "API endpoint", "interface", "DTO", "type definition"
- **Action**: Automatic trigger of architecture discovery process
- **Enforcement**: Cannot proceed to implementation without discovery completion

#### 3. Contract Validation Agent
- **Purpose**: Validate API assumptions against actual endpoints
