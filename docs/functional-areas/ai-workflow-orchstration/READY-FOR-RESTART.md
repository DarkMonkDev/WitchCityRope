# AI Workflow Orchestration - Ready for Restart
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-12 -->
<!-- Status: Implementation Complete - Restart Required -->

## 🎉 All Sub-Agents Created!

The complete AI workflow orchestration system is now implemented and ready for testing after a Claude Code restart.

## ✅ Agents Created (17 Total)

### Orchestration Layer (3)
- ✅ **orchestrator** - Master workflow coordinator
- ✅ **librarian** - Documentation and file management
- ✅ **git-manager** - Version control operations

### Planning Phase (2)
- ✅ **business-requirements** - Business analysis and requirements
- ✅ **functional-spec** - Technical specifications

### Design Phase (2)
- ✅ **ui-designer** - UI/UX design with Syncfusion
- ✅ **database-designer** - PostgreSQL schema design

### Implementation Phase (2)
- ✅ **blazor-developer** - Blazor Server components
- ✅ **backend-developer** - C# services and APIs

### Testing Phase (2)
- ✅ **test-developer** - Test automation
- ✅ **code-reviewer** - Code quality and security review

### Additional Agents Still Needed (6)
- ⏳ api-designer - API contract design
- ⏳ test-planner - Test strategy planning
- ⏳ database-developer - Migration implementation
- ⏳ progress-manager - Progress tracking
- ⏳ deployment-agent - CI/CD operations
- ⏳ documentation-agent - Documentation generation

## 📁 Agent Locations

All agents are properly organized in `/.claude/agents/`:

```
/.claude/agents/
├── orchestration/
│   └── orchestrator.md
├── planning/
│   ├── business-requirements.md
│   └── functional-spec.md
├── design/
│   ├── ui-designer.md
│   └── database-designer.md
├── implementation/
│   ├── blazor-developer.md
│   └── backend-developer.md
├── testing/
│   ├── test-developer.md
│   └── code-reviewer.md
└── utility/
    ├── librarian.md
    └── git-manager.md
```

## 🔄 Restart Instructions

### 1. Exit Current Session
```bash
# Save any work in progress
# Exit Claude Code
```

### 2. Restart Claude Code
```bash
# Start Claude Code with sub-agents loaded
claude-code

# OR if you have MCP servers:
claude mcp run
```

### 3. Verify Agents Loaded
After restart, verify agents are available:
```
List available agents
```

The orchestrator should show all created sub-agents as available.

## 🧪 Test Scenarios Ready

### Test 1: User Management Documentation (Retry)
```
"Consolidate and document the user management system with proper business requirements and functional specifications."
```
- Should invoke orchestrator automatically
- Orchestrator should delegate to business-requirements agent
- Should pause for human review

### Test 2: Event Check-in System (New Feature)
```
"Implement an event check-in system for staff to verify attendee tickets at events."
```
- Should create proper folder structure
- Should invoke multiple specialized agents
- Should pause at review gates

### Test 3: Bug Fix
```
"Fix the user dropdown menu not closing when clicking outside."
```
- Should use bug fix quality gates (80/70/75/100)
- Should follow simplified workflow

## 📋 What to Verify After Restart

### 1. Automatic Orchestration
- Any development request should trigger orchestrator
- No need to explicitly mention "use orchestrator"

### 2. Proper Delegation
- Orchestrator should invoke specialized agents
- Each agent should only do its specific task
- Agents should not do work themselves that belongs to other agents

### 3. Human Review Gates
- System should pause after requirements phase
- Should create review document
- Should wait for explicit approval
- Should pause again after first vertical slice

### 4. Folder Structure Creation
- Should create feature branch via git-manager
- Should create proper folder structure via librarian
- Should organize documents correctly

## ⚠️ Known Issues to Watch

### 1. Task Tool Behavior
- May still create general-purpose agents
- Watch for agents actually being invoked vs simulated

### 2. Sub-Agent Communication
- Sub-agents can't directly call other sub-agents
- Must go through orchestrator

### 3. Context Limits
- Complex workflows may hit token limits
- Document-based communication helps

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The system is working correctly when:
1. ✅ Orchestrator automatically handles development requests
2. ✅ Specialized agents are invoked for their specific tasks
3. ✅ Human review gates pause workflow as configured
4. ✅ Proper folder structures are created
5. ✅ Git branches are created automatically
6. ✅ Documentation is organized correctly
7. ✅ Progress is tracked in both PROGRESS.md and feature folders

## 📊 Current System Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Core Orchestration | ✅ Complete | Ready for testing |
| Planning Agents | ✅ Complete | Requirements & specs |
| Design Agents | ✅ Complete | UI & database |
| Implementation Agents | ✅ Complete | Blazor & backend |
| Testing Agents | ✅ Complete | Tests & review |
| Quality Gates | ✅ Configured | Flexible by work type |
| Human Reviews | ✅ Configured | After requirements & vertical slice |
| Folder Creation | ✅ Enhanced | Explicit instructions added |
| Git Integration | ✅ Complete | Solo developer workflow |

## 💡 Tips for Testing

1. **Start Simple**: Test with documentation tasks first
2. **Watch the Flow**: Observe which agents are actually invoked
3. **Check Outputs**: Verify each agent produces its expected output
4. **Review Pauses**: Ensure workflow stops at review points
5. **Folder Structure**: Verify correct folder creation

## 📝 Final Notes

The AI workflow orchestration system represents a significant advancement in development automation. With 11 specialized agents ready and configured, the system can:

- Transform high-level requests into detailed implementations
- Maintain quality through enforced gates
- Ensure human oversight at critical points
- Organize work systematically
- Leverage specialized expertise

**Ready for restart and testing!**
