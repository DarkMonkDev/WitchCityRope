# CRITICAL FIX: Human Review Gates Not Working
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-12 -->
<!-- Status: URGENT FIX -->

## Problem Identified
During our first test, the orchestrator proceeded through requirements and design phases WITHOUT stopping for human approval. This violates our core workflow design.

## Root Cause
The Task tool invoked a general-purpose agent instead of our specific orchestrator agent. The general-purpose agent doesn't have our human review gate instructions.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Orchestrator Configuration
Updated `/claude/agents/orchestration/orchestrator.md`:
- Added CRITICAL HUMAN REVIEW GATE sections
- Emphasized MUST PAUSE AND WAIT instructions
- Added explicit review document requirements

### 2. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Clarified that orchestrator MUST be used for development tasks
- Added warning box about human review points

### 3. Proper Invocation Method

## Correct Way to Start Orchestrated Work

Instead of using the Task tool, we need to ensure the orchestrator agent is directly invoked. Here are the options:

### Option 1: Direct Orchestrator Invocation
When you want to start development work, explicitly mention the orchestrator:
```
"Use the orchestrator to implement a user management admin screen that allows administrators to view, edit, and manage user accounts, roles, and permissions."
```

### Option 2: Configure Automatic Orchestrator Use
The system should automatically recognize multi-step development work and invoke the orchestrator, not a general-purpose agent.

## Verification Checklist

The orchestrator MUST:
- [ ] Stop after Phase 1 (Requirements) 
- [ ] Create review document at `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/new-work/[date]/review-phase1.md`
- [ ] Explicitly say "WAITING FOR PM APPROVAL" 
- [ ] Not proceed until you say "Approved" or "Continue"
- [ ] Stop again after first vertical slice implementation
- [ ] Create another review document
- [ ] Wait for second approval

## Test Commands

### Incorrect (What happened):
```
Task: general-purpose agent
Result: Skipped human reviews
```

### Correct (What should happen):
```
Orchestrator: Implement user management
Result: Pauses after requirements for approval
```

## Review Document Template

When the orchestrator pauses, it should create:

```markdown
# Phase 1 Review: Requirements & Planning
<!-- Created: [Date] -->
<!-- Status: AWAITING APPROVAL -->

## Completed Documents
- Business Requirements: [link]
- Functional Specification: [link]
- UI Wireframes (if applicable): [link]

## Key Decisions Made
- [List major decisions]

## Questions/Concerns
- [Any issues identified]

## Quality Gate Score
- Requirements Completeness: X%
- Threshold Required: 95%
- Status: PASS/FAIL

## Next Phase Preview
If approved, Phase 2 will include:
- Technical design
- Component architecture
- Database schema

## Approval Required
**THE WORKFLOW IS PAUSED**
Please review the above documents and respond with:
- "Approved" to continue
- "Changes needed: [specifics]" to revise
- "Abort" to cancel workflow

Waiting for Product Manager approval...
```

## Improvement for Future

### 1. Orchestrator Should Be More Assertive
The orchestrator needs to be the default for ANY multi-step development work.

### 2. Clear Pause Mechanism
When pausing for review, the orchestrator should:
- Create obvious visual break
- State "WORKFLOW PAUSED - AWAITING APPROVAL"
- Not continue until explicit approval

### 3. Fail-Safe Check
Before starting Phase 2 or 3, orchestrator should verify:
- Was previous phase approved?
- If no approval record exists, STOP and ask

## Lessons Learned

1. **Agent Invocation Matters**: The specific agent invoked must have the full workflow rules
2. **Explicit Instructions Needed**: "WAIT FOR APPROVAL" must be unmistakably clear
3. **Review Documents Essential**: Physical documents ensure reviews happen
4. **Testing Revealed Gap**: Good that we tested before full implementation

## Next Test

Let's retry with explicit orchestrator invocation:
```
"Orchestrator: Implement a user management admin screen that allows administrators to view, edit, and manage user accounts, roles, and permissions."
```

Expected behavior:
1. Creates requirements
2. **STOPS and waits for approval**
3. Only continues after you approve

**This is a critical fix to ensure human oversight is maintained throughout the workflow.**
