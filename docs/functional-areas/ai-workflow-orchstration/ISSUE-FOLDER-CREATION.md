# ISSUE: Orchestrator Not Creating Proper Folder Structure
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-12 -->
<!-- Status: Identified and Fixed -->

## Problem Summary
During our first test, the orchestrator failed to create the expected folder structure for the user management admin screen feature.

## Expected Behavior
The orchestrator should have created:
```
/docs/functional-areas/user-management/
└── new-work/
    └── 2025-08-12-admin-screen/
        ├── requirements/
        │   ├── business-requirements.md
        │   └── functional-spec.md
        ├── design/
        │   ├── technical-design.md
        │   └── ui-wireframes.md
        ├── implementation/
        │   └── task-breakdown.md
        ├── testing/
        │   └── test-plan.md
        ├── reviews/
        │   └── phase1-review.md
        └── progress.md
```

## What Actually Happened
- No folder structure was created
- Review document was placed in wrong location: `/docs/functional-areas/ai-workflow-orchstration/reviews/`
- No git branch was created
- No proper progress tracking initialized

## Root Causes

### 1. Wrong Agent Invoked
- Task tool invoked a general-purpose agent instead of our orchestrator
- General-purpose agent doesn't have folder creation instructions

### 2. Orchestrator Instructions Not Explicit Enough
- Folder creation steps weren't clearly mandatory
- Didn't specify to invoke librarian and git-manager agents

### 3. No Verification Step
- Orchestrator didn't verify folders were created before proceeding

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Orchestrator Instructions
Added CRITICAL FIRST STEPS section with:
- Explicit requirement to invoke git-manager for branch creation
- Explicit requirement to invoke librarian for folder creation
- Complete folder structure diagram
- Verification step

### 2. Automatic Orchestrator Invocation
Created orchestration trigger rules so orchestrator is automatically used for:
- Any request with "implement", "create", "build", etc.
- Multi-step development tasks

### 3. Folder Structure Requirements
Added explicit section about folder requirements for every scope of work

## Verification for Next Test

Before proceeding to requirements phase, orchestrator MUST:
1. ✅ Create git branch via git-manager
2. ✅ Create folder structure via librarian
3. ✅ Verify folders exist
4. ✅ Initialize progress.md in scope folder
5. ✅ Update main PROGRESS.md

## Test Command for Retry
Since user management already exists, try a different feature:
```
"Implement an event check-in system for staff to verify attendee tickets at events"
```

This should:
1. Auto-invoke orchestrator
2. Create `/docs/functional-areas/event-checkin/new-work/2025-08-12-checkin-system/`
3. Create all subfolders
4. Generate requirements
5. PAUSE for approval

## Lessons Learned

1. **Be Explicit**: Every step must be explicitly stated in agent instructions
2. **Invoke Other Agents**: Orchestrator should delegate folder/git operations
3. **Verify Actions**: Always verify critical actions completed
4. **Test the Actual Agent**: Ensure the right agent is invoked, not generic ones

## Improvements for Orchestrator

The orchestrator now:
- Has explicit folder creation instructions
- Must invoke librarian for folder operations
- Must invoke git-manager for branch operations
- Must verify folders exist before proceeding
- Has clear folder structure template

This issue revealed the importance of explicit instructions and proper agent delegation in our orchestration system.
