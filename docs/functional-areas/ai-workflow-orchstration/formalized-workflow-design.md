<!-- Status: Draft - Pending Review -->

## Executive Summary

This document presents a formalized AI workflow orchestration system specifically designed for the WitchCityRope project, leveraging Claude Code's new dedicated sub-agent functionality (released July 2025). The system implements a phased development approach with specialized agents, quality gates, and comprehensive documentation management.

## Quality Agent Delegation Rules

### Lint Validator Agent Usage
**When to Use:**
- During Phase 4 (Testing & Validation) - MANDATORY for all code changes
- Before any code review process
- After implementation phase completion
- When code quality issues are suspected

**Delegation Pattern:**
```
Task(
    subagent_type="lint-validator",
    description="Validate code quality for [specific files/modules]",
    prompt="Run linting tools on [file paths] and report any violations. Fix critical issues and report warnings."
)
```

### Prettier Formatter Agent Usage
**When to Use:**
- During Phase 5 (Finalization) - MANDATORY before code review
- Before any pull request creation
- After all development work is complete
- When code style consistency is needed

**Delegation Pattern:**
```
Task(
    subagent_type="prettier-formatter",
    description="Format code for [specific files/modules]",
    prompt="Apply Prettier formatting to [file paths]. Ensure consistent style across all files."
)
```

### Quality Gate Integration
- **Phase 4**: Lint validation must pass with zero critical errors before proceeding
- **Phase 5**: Code formatting must be applied before final review
- **Code Review**: Both linting and formatting must be complete before reviewer agent delegation

## Communication & Coordination Model

### Document-Based Communication

Each agent communicates through specific documents stored in the scope of work folder:

```
/docs/functional-areas/[feature-name]/new-work/
├── requirements/
│   ├── business-requirements.md
│   └── functional-spec.md
├── design/
│   ├── technical-design.md
│   ├── database-schema.md
│   └── api-contracts.md
├── implementation/
│   ├── task-breakdown.md
│   └── implementation-notes.md
├── testing/
│   ├── test-plan.md
│   └── test-results.md
├── progress/
│   ├── status.md
│   └── blockers.md
└── artifacts/
    └── [generated files]
```

### Progress Tracking

The orchestrator maintains a master progress document:

```markdown
## Current Scope: [Feature Name]
**Phase**: [Current Phase]
**Status**: [In Progress/Blocked/Complete]
**Quality Gate**: [Pass/Fail - Score]

### Phase Progress
- [ ] Phase 1: Requirements (95% complete)
- [ ] Phase 2: Design (Not Started)
- [ ] Phase 3: Implementation (Not Started)
- [ ] Phase 4: Testing (Not Started)
- [ ] Phase 5: Finalization (Not Started)

### Active Agents
- [Agent Name]: [Current Task]

### Blockers
- [Description of any blockers]

### Next Steps
- [Immediate next actions]
```

## File Access Control Matrix

| Agent Type | Read | Write | Create | Delete | Directories |
|------------|------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Orchestrator | All | Progress, Status | Folders | None | All |
| Librarian | All | All Docs | All Docs | Temp Files | /docs/, /session-work/ |
| Git Manager | All | None | None | None | All |
| Requirements | Docs | Requirements | Requirements | None | /docs/functional-areas/ |
| Design | All | Design Docs | Design Docs | None | /docs/functional-areas/ |
| Developers | All | Code, Tests | Code, Tests | None | /src/, /tests/ |
| Testers | All | Tests, Results | Tests, Results | None | /tests/, /docs/ |
| Lint Validator | All | Lint Reports | Lint Reports | None | /src/, /tests/, /docs/ |
| Prettier Formatter | All | Code (formatting only) | None | None | /src/, /tests/ |
| Reviewers | All | Review Docs | Review Docs | None | /docs/ |

## Quality Gates & Thresholds

### Gate Enforcement Rules

1. **Automatic Progression**: If quality gate passes, proceed to next phase
2. **Human Review Required**: If gate fails, request human intervention
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Allow one retry after addressing feedback
4. **Emergency Override**: Product Manager can override gates

### Quality Metrics

| Phase | Metric | Threshold | Measurement |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Requirements | Completeness | 95% | All sections filled, examples provided |
| Design | Approval Score | 90% | Technical feasibility, pattern adherence |
| Implementation | Test Coverage | 85% | Code coverage reports |
| Testing | Pass Rate | 100% | All tests must pass |
| Finalization | PM Approval | Required | Manual review |

## Implementation Considerations

### Questions for Product Manager

1. **Quality Gate Flexibility**: Should quality gates be configurable per scope of work, or fixed at these levels?

2. **Parallel Execution**: Should we allow parallel agent execution within phases (e.g., frontend and backend development simultaneously)?

3. **Human Checkpoints**: Beyond quality gates, where else would you like mandatory human review points?

4. **Agent Autonomy**: How much freedom should agents have to:
   - Create new files/folders outside their designated areas?
   - Modify existing code without explicit approval?
   - Skip phases if they determine they're not needed?

5. **Progress Reporting**: How frequently should the orchestrator report progress?
   - After each agent completes
   - At phase boundaries only
   - Configurable based on scope size

6. **Error Handling**: When an agent encounters an error:
   - Should it retry automatically?
   - Escalate immediately to human?
   - Try alternative approaches?

7. **Documentation Depth**: For each phase, what level of documentation is required?
   - Comprehensive (all decisions documented)
   - Summary (key decisions only)
   - Minimal (just outcomes)

8. **Branch Strategy**: Should each scope of work:
   - Create its own feature branch automatically?
   - Work on a shared development branch?
   - Let the orchestrator decide based on scope size?

### Technical Constraints

1. **Token Limits**: Complex scopes may require context management strategies
2. **Tool Access**: Sub-agents cannot call other sub-agents directly (must go through orchestrator)
3. **State Management**: Agents are stateless; all state must be persisted to documents
4. **Performance**: Sequential phases may be slower than parallel execution

## Proposed CLAUDE.md Structure

The CLAUDE.md file should be restructured for the orchestration agent:

```markdown
# Claude Code Orchestration Configuration

## Orchestration Mode
This session is configured for orchestrated AI workflow development.

## Available Agents
- See /.claude/agents/ for all available sub-agents
- Primary orchestrator: orchestrator
- Support agents: librarian, git-manager

## Workflow Process
1. Receive scope of work
2. Initialize workflow with orchestrator
3. Progress through phases with quality gates
4. Complete with documentation and review

## Quick Commands
- Start new scope: "Orchestrate: [description]"
- Check progress: "Status report"
- Override gate: "Override gate with reason: [reason]"

[Rest of current CLAUDE.md content...]
```

## Next Steps

Upon approval of this design:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** (Week 1)
   - Create .claude/agents/ directory structure
   - Implement core orchestration agents
   - Set up communication folders

2. **Phase 2: Core Agents** (Week 2)
   - Implement planning phase agents
   - Implement design phase agents
   - Create quality gate checking

3. **Phase 3: Development Agents** (Week 3)
   - Implement React/TypeScript development agents
   - Implement testing agents
   - Create progress tracking

4. **Phase 4: Integration** (Week 4)
   - Test full workflow with sample scope
   - Refine based on results
   - Document lessons learned

## Conclusion

This formalized workflow design leverages the latest Claude Code sub-agent capabilities to create a sophisticated, phase-based development system specifically tailored to the WitchCityRope project's technology stack and requirements. The system emphasizes quality gates, clear communication patterns, and comprehensive documentation while maintaining flexibility for human oversight and intervention.
