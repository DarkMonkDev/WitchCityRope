AI Software Development Workflow

This is a stream of Consciousness that will be cleaned up by an AI tool later but this defines the software development workflow that I will use in Claude code

Throughout this entire workflow process we refer to as the product manager as the human overseeing this AI workflow development. anytime we refer to the product manager that refers to a physical human doing an action not an AI agent. 

Project Kickoff
Any development project will start with The product manager starting an orchestration agent and pointing that agent to an enhancement or work request document. This document will be supplied as possibly a PR in GitHub, a mark down file, or might just be part of a prompt Used to initialize the orchestration agent. Enhancement or work request defines at a very high level the scope of work and the type of change that this scope of work will be implementing.

Business Requirements
For any scope of work the first step is to flush out the enhancement / work request to clearly define at a high level the workâ€™s scope. To do this, the orchestration agent will spin up a business requirements agent that will take the high level work request, research both public and existing features for this type of work or feature, ask the product manager for additional input from the user, suggest additional features or business requirements ( however keeping this to a minimum), review the goals of both the overall coding project as well as this functional area, and develop a formal business / high level requirements document. The document  will be in a standard document format. Once this document is completed it will be reviewed, edited and approved by a human. It is important that this agent ask questions as they're developing the business requirements document if they have ideas, are unsure, or would like additional input.

Functional Specification
After the business requirements document is finished and approved the next stage will be to spin up a functional requirements agent that will review the current architecture technology stack, the business requirements document, existing product features, and understand the current technology that's being used in this architectural stock as well as research if needed additional things from internet sources. it will try to use existing patterns existing tools and the existing add-ons and Technology stock without adding any additional items if possible. however if it does make the most sense to add an additional add-on then that can be suggested in the functional specification document or ask of the user as the functional specification document is being created. the Agent will create a functional spec in the standard format that we've established for functional specification documents. once completed the  document will be presented for review and approval. 

Optional UI design phase
If a UI change is needed for this scope of work then the first thing that will happen in this phase is the orchestration agent will spin up a UI design agent that will either augment the existing UI design in this functional area folder or create a new  UI design based on the business requirements and functional specification. The UI design will need to be reviewed and approved before this phase continues. It is possible, that while doing the UI design the functional specifications may change or be updated. It is important that the UI design agent  update either the business requirements document or functional specification. however before it makes those updates it should propose the updates to the end user.

Functional, Testing design / planning
The Next Step will be spinning up a functional implementation agent that will review the functional spec review our existing code base and detail the specific changes that will be made to the code base in order to implement the functional spec. This agent will create a plan for the implementation that includes a vertical slice implementation strategy. with the strategy we will try to test early and often any new functionality before that functionality is rolled out to many additional places. this agent will not Implement any of the functions but is a planning and strategy agent telling the implementation agents exactly what to do how to do it the order to do it in, and the functionality that needs to be tested early before it is implemented in many locations.

During this stage we will also spin up a testing agent whose job it is to review the business requirements and functional spec and define but not create unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. This agent will review the existing test we have in each category to see if we can leverage existing tests without creating entirely new tests. this agent will be in charge of maintaining a list of tests in all three categories with their definitions so that it is not required to sort through all of the tests. this agent will also know where the tests are located.

Work implementation phase
When the implementation planning phase is complete and approved the orchestration agent will begin the implementation. This will involve following the implementation and test development plan, including doing vertical slice development to test functionality before it is rolled out. The orchestration agent can spin up front end coding, back end coding, test development (unit, integration and/or e2e agents) and database design agents as the implementation plan requires. Once the vertical slice phase of this scope of work is completed the orchestration agent can spin up as many of these types of Agents as is needed to complete the this phase, working with parallel agents when possible. This phase will only be considered completed when all of the testing and coding implementation steps are complete, and the test and source project compiles (includes API, UI and domain layer libraries). 

Test - develop - finalize
Once the implementation phase is completed, the orchestration agent will spin up testing agents that may include unit, integration and end-to-end test agents. Each of these test agents will run all of the test under their specific area compile documentation of the results at a detailed level such that the coding agents can use the results and try to solve whatever problems are documented.




Throughout every phase of this work flow any agent MUST call the librarian agent if they want  to create a new document, find existing internal documents or move existing internal documents. The librarian agent is in charge of knowing where all documents are stored, making sure the folder structures are being maintained, logging temporary files versus permanent files in our document tracking system, making sure documents are cleaned up that are temporary after that phase of work is completed, Making suggestions to the human project manager about better ways to store documents or improve our documentation workflow. the librarian manages all files except for the project coding files specific to.net code development  And e2e Scripts and files inside the testing sub-project. the librarian will maintain a folder structure document that includes all folders not counting the code source project folder and tests project folder. The librarian should routinely make suggestions about project folder and file structure readability trying to keep the overall file and folder management structured in a way that is easy to read and follow by another developer. the librarian should keep an overview document that explains the general layout and file structure both for itself and users trying to understand the file and folder structure for this project.The library in Austin to make sure that files are included in the get Repository or if they are temporary files like image files used in testing that they are included in the get ignore file.The librarian upon the start of a new scope of work will set up the folder structure and put the default documents used to create any scope of work in that folder structure and inform the orchestration agent where that folder is located so that it can tell the sub agents where they should store all of their work at. sub agents can also call the librarian or the orchestration agent if needed. the librarian will manage what folders relate to what scope of work so that when the orchestration agent or sub agents call it to find documents librarian can easily and accurately tell the sub agents where to go or What photo structure to store all documents in. 

Overseeing the entire scope of work is the orchestration agent. the orchestration agent is intimately familiar with this workflow process and consistently looks for ways to improve the process based on results and lessons learned. the orchestration agent manages the progress document both at a global level as well as making sure each sub agent updates functional area progress documents and that the librarian is notified when scopes of work are completed and does the cleanup tasks that the librarian is in charge of. the orchestration agent will spin up and direct sub agents telling the sub agents exactly where to find the scope of work documentation and work folders that they are currently working on and maintains a level of communication between the agents. the orchestration agent will ask the end user questions to help Define scope , and keep the end user aware of changes being made or progress on the scope of work. since this is a new process I would like the orchestration agent to check in often and not have sub agents to too much work before the project manager human sees what is going on and approves moving to the next step. the orchestration agent will make sure that the code for the scope of work is  committed to the local get Repository very often and especially after each stage of work is completed. it will know what the branch or other get repository mechanism that this scope of work is named and being managed under. and will be in charge of telling our get agent to both create the branch and merge the branch once it is done in the global Repository on GitHub. 

You also have a dedicated sub agent for our get repository management that all other agents will call and use during their workflow process. this agent will be in charge of knowing and managing all of the branches being used locally for each development effort. it can direct the orchestration agent or sub agents on where to do their development work for a specific branch. this agent should be called often to commit locally and called at the end of the overall workflow process to both commit locally merge back to the main branch and commit to GitHub. 

General project notes
Each agent should update the local functional progress document with their specific progress such that if they had to stop and come back to this work they would know exactly where they were and be able to pick up where they left off. the librarian agent should be used to find where the local functional progress document is


The orchestration agent needs access to the main Clause MD file and the main progress MD file. 

Lessons Learned and best practice files that are specific to certain agents that are not specific to specific functional development efforts should be known about with their location and what information should be stored within them inside the definition of each agent. the agents should maintain these Lessons Learned files as development efforts happen. some sub agents will need access to multiple lesson learned or procedural files. The librarian should be made aware of any new Lessons Learned files or moving a Lessons Learned file but overall no additional files you probably be made. however agents are welcome to suggest better structures to have lessons learned procedure and guide for their specific work areas.
