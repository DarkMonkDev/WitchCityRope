# Test Scenario: User Management Admin Screen
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-12 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: AI Workflow Team -->
<!-- Status: Ready for Testing -->

## Test Objective
Validate the AI workflow orchestration system by implementing a user management admin screen through the complete development lifecycle.

## Scope Definition

### High-Level Request
"Implement a user management admin screen that allows administrators to view, edit, and manage user accounts, roles, and permissions."

### Expected Workflow Type
- **Type**: Feature Development
- **Size**: Medium
- **Quality Gates**: Requirements(95%) → Design(90%) → Implementation(85%) → Testing(100%)

## Expected Workflow Progression

### Phase 1: Requirements & Planning
**Orchestrator Actions:**
1. Create feature branch: `feature/2025-08-12-user-management-admin`
2. Create scope folder: `/docs/functional-areas/user-management/new-work/2025-08-12-admin-screen/`
3. Invoke `business-requirements` agent
4. Invoke `functional-spec` agent
5. Create review document
6. **PAUSE for human approval**

**Expected Outputs:**
- Business requirements document with user stories
- Functional specification with technical approach
- Review document for PM approval

### Phase 2: Design & Architecture
**Orchestrator Actions:**
1. Invoke `blazor-architect` agent
2. Design component hierarchy
3. Define service interfaces
4. Plan data models

**Expected Outputs:**
- Technical design document
- Component structure
- Service architecture
- Database schema (if needed)

### Phase 3: Implementation
**Orchestrator Actions:**
1. Invoke `blazor-developer` agent
2. Create UserManagement.razor page
3. Implement UserManagementService
4. Add validators
5. **PAUSE after first vertical slice for review**

**Expected Components:**
```
/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Features/Admin/
├── Pages/
│   └── UserManagement.razor
├── Components/
│   └── UserGrid.razor
├── Services/
│   ├── IUserManagementService.cs
│   └── UserManagementService.cs
├── Models/
│   └── UserManagementDto.cs
└── Validators/
    └── UserEditValidator.cs
```

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
**Orchestrator Actions:**
1. Create unit tests for service
2. Create component tests
3. Add E2E test for user management flow
4. Run all tests
5. Perform code review

**Expected Tests:**
- Unit tests for UserManagementService
- bUnit tests for UserManagement.razor
- Playwright E2E test for admin workflow

### Phase 5: Finalization
**Orchestrator Actions:**
1. Update PROGRESS.md
2. Complete feature documentation
3. Capture lessons learned
4. Present improvement suggestions
5. Merge to main branch

## Validation Criteria

### Success Indicators
- [ ] All phases completed
- [ ] Quality gates passed or overridden with reason
- [ ] Human reviews completed at designated points
- [ ] All files in correct locations
- [ ] No `/docs/docs/` folders created
- [ ] Git commits at each phase
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete

### Potential Issues to Test
1. **Quality Gate Failure**: What happens if requirements are only 90% complete?
2. **Parallel Execution**: Can frontend and backend work simultaneously?
3. **Error Recovery**: How does system handle service implementation failure?
4. **Human Review Delay**: Does workflow wait properly for approval?

## Test Execution Commands

### Start Test
```
"Orchestrate: Implement a user management admin screen that allows administrators to view, edit, and manage user accounts, roles, and permissions."
```

### Progress Checks
```
"Status"
"Show current phase"
"What agents are active?"
```

### Quality Gate Override (if needed)
```
"Override gate with reason: Testing workflow with incomplete requirements"
```

## Expected Timeline
- Phase 1: 30-45 minutes
- Human Review: Variable
- Phase 2: 20-30 minutes
- Phase 3: 45-60 minutes
- Human Review: Variable
- Phase 4: 30-40 minutes
- Phase 5: 15-20 minutes

**Total**: 3-4 hours of active development (excluding review time)

## Metrics to Track
- Time per phase
- Number of agent invocations
- Quality gate scores achieved
- Number of retries needed
- Documentation completeness
- Test coverage achieved
- Files created/modified

## Post-Test Review Questions
1. Did the orchestrator manage phases effectively?
2. Were quality gates appropriate?
3. Did agents produce expected outputs?
4. Was documentation properly organized?
5. Were there any unexpected failures?
6. What improvements were identified?

## Notes for Product Manager

This test will validate:
- Orchestration flow
- Agent coordination
- Quality gate enforcement
- Human review integration
- Document organization
- Git workflow
- Error handling
- Improvement tracking

After this test, we'll have confidence in the system's ability to handle real development work.
