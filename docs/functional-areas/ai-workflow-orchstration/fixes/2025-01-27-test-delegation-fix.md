# Orchestrator Test Delegation Fix
Date: 2025-01-27
Session: User Management Implementation

## Problem Identified
The orchestrator was violating its core principle of "delegation only" by:
- Running tests directly using Bash tool
- Attempting to fix compilation errors itself
- Executing implementation commands (dotnet build, etc.)
- Making file edits to fix issues

This meant specialized agents with domain knowledge and lessons-learned weren't being used.

## Root Cause
1. Orchestrator configuration stated delegation rules but wasn't strict enough
2. No specialized agent existed for test-fix coordination
3. Orchestrator didn't recognize test/fix work as requiring delegation

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created test-fix-coordinator Agent
- Location: `/.claude/agents/testing/test-fix-coordinator.md`
- Purpose: Manage iterative test-fix cycles
- Responsibilities:
  - Run tests and analyze failures
  - Delegate fixes to appropriate specialized agents
  - Track progress through iterations
  - Report back to orchestrator

### 2. Enhanced Orchestrator Rules
- Added STRICT prohibitions with violation detection
- Made test-fix-coordinator MANDATORY for all test work
- Added recognition patterns for test/fix scenarios
- Provided clear delegation patterns

### 3. Delegation Flow
```
User Request → Orchestrator → test-fix-coordinator → Specialized Agents
                     ↓                                      ↓
              (Coordination only)                  (Actual implementation)
```

## Key Changes to Orchestrator

### Stricter Prohibitions
- STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from any implementation work
- Violation detection mechanism added
- Clear consequences stated (orchestration failure)

### Test Work Recognition
Added patterns to recognize when test delegation is needed:
- "Run tests and fix failures"
- "Make the tests pass"
- "Fix compilation errors"
- Any test execution scenario

### Mandatory Delegation Pattern
```
Task: test-fix-coordinator
Prompt: Run [test suite] and coordinate fixes
Context: [feature/phase]
Maximum iterations: 5
```

## Benefits
1. **Specialized Knowledge**: Each agent's lessons-learned are utilized
2. **Proper Patterns**: Domain experts handle their specific areas
3. **Clear Separation**: Orchestrator coordinates, agents implement
4. **Quality Assurance**: test-fix-coordinator ensures systematic fixing
5. **Scalability**: New specialized agents can be added without changing orchestrator

## Testing the Fix
To verify this works correctly:
1. Request orchestrator to continue user management implementation
2. When it reaches testing phase, it should delegate to test-fix-coordinator
3. test-fix-coordinator should run tests and delegate fixes to appropriate agents
4. Orchestrator should NEVER use Bash, Edit, or Write tools for implementation

## Lessons Learned
- Delegation rules must be EXTREMELY explicit and strict
- Specialized coordinators needed for complex multi-step processes
- Pattern recognition helps orchestrator identify delegation scenarios
- Violation detection mechanisms prevent regression

## Next Steps
- Monitor orchestrator behavior in next invocation
- Ensure test-fix-coordinator properly delegates to specialized agents
- Consider similar coordinators for other complex workflows
- Update other agents if they have similar issues
