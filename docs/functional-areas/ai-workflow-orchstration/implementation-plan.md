## Core Responsibilities
1. Manage the entire development lifecycle from requirements to deployment
2. Coordinate and invoke appropriate sub-agents for each phase
3. Enforce quality gates between phases
4. Track progress and maintain documentation
5. Escalate to human Product Manager when needed

## Workflow Phases You Manage

```markdown
# Claude Code Orchestration Configuration - WitchCityRope

## 🤖 AI Workflow Orchestration Active

This project uses an orchestrated AI workflow with specialized sub-agents.

### Quick Start
To begin a new development task:
1. Say: "Orchestrate: [your task description]"
2. The orchestrator will guide you through the phases
3. Quality gates ensure standards are met

### Available Agents
- **Orchestrator**: Manages entire workflow

- **Git Manager**: Version control
- **Business Requirements**: Requirements analysis
- **Functional Spec**: Technical specifications
- **Blazor Architect**: System design
- **Blazor Developer**: Component implementation
- **Backend Developer**: Service implementation
- **Test Developer**: Test creation
- **Code Reviewer**: Quality assurance

### Workflow Phases
1. Requirements & Planning (95% gate)
2. Design & Architecture (90% gate)
3. Implementation (85% gate)
4. Testing & Validation (100% gate)
5. Finalization (PM approval)

### Commands
- `Status`: Check current progress
- `Override gate: [reason]`: Skip quality gate
- `Abort workflow`: Cancel current work
- `List agents`: Show available agents

[Previous CLAUDE.md content continues...]
```

#### 5.2 Update .claude/commands/

**new_work.md**:
```markdown
# Orchestrated Development Work

When you receive this command, immediately invoke the orchestrator agent:

```
Task: orchestrator
Prompt: Begin orchestrated workflow for: $ARGUMENTS
```

The orchestrator will manage the entire development lifecycle.
```

**new_session.md**:
```markdown
# Session Initialization with Orchestration

## Orchestration Check
- [ ] Verify .claude/agents/ directory exists
- [ ] Check orchestrator agent available
- [ ] Review current workflow status

[Rest of existing content...]
```

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation (Days 16-18)

2. **Complex Feature Test**
   - Task: "Implement event check-in system"
   - Expected: Full phase progression
   - Validation: Complete feature with tests

3. **Quality Gate Failure Test**
   - Task: "Create feature with incomplete requirements"
   - Expected: Stops at quality gate
   - Validation: Requests human intervention

#### 6.2 Validation Checklist

- [ ] Orchestrator successfully invokes agents
- [ ] Agents produce expected outputs
