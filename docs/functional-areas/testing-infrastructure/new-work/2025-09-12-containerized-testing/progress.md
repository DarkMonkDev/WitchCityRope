# Containerized Testing Infrastructure Research - Progress Tracking
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-12 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Testing Team -->
<!-- Status: Research Phase - Initial Setup -->

## Project Overview
**Objective**: Research and evaluate containerized testing infrastructure for WitchCityRope test suites using fresh Docker containers with blank PostgreSQL databases.

**Key Questions**:
- Should we spin up fresh Docker containers for each test suite execution?
- How do we efficiently apply migrations and seed data to blank databases?
- What are the performance vs reliability trade-offs?
- How does this integrate with GitHub Actions CI/CD?
- How do we prevent orphaned containers?

**Context**: This is a research and planning task (not implementation) to determine best practices for test isolation and infrastructure modernization.

4. **Resource Management**: What are the CPU/memory/disk requirements?
5. **Container Cleanup**: How do we prevent orphaned containers effectively?

### Secondary Questions
1. **Development Experience**: How does this affect local development workflows?
2. **Debugging**: How do we debug issues within containerized tests?
3. **Parallel Execution**: Can we run multiple containerized test suites simultaneously?
4. **Cost Analysis**: What are the infrastructure cost implications?
5. **Migration Path**: How do we transition from current testing approach?
