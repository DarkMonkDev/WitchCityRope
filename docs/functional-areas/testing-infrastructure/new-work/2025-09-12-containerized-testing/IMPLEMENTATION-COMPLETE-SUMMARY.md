### ✅ 3. GitHub Actions CI/CD Compatibility
**Requirement**: Must work seamlessly with GitHub Actions  
**Solution Delivered**:
- 4 comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows
- Service container configuration
- Resource management within GitHub limits
- Parallel job support
**Result**: Full CI/CD integration ready

### ✅ 4. Dynamic Port Management
**Requirement**: No port conflicts across different environments  
**Solution Delivered**:
- Automatic OS port allocation (port 0 binding)
- Dynamic connection string injection
- Environment-agnostic configuration
**Result**: Zero port conflicts guaranteed

### ✅ 5. Database Reset and Seed Tools
**Requirement**: Easy way to reset and seed development database  
**Solution Delivered**:
- `reset-database.sh` script with error handling
- `seed-database-enhanced.sh` with environment support
- Support for both dev and test databases
**Result**: One-command database management
