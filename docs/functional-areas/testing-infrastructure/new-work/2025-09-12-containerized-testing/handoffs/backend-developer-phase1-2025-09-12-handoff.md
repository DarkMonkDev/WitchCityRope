- **Solution**: Audit completed, standardization roadmap created for Phase 2

### Performance Requirements
- **Constraint**: 2-4x performance trade-off acceptable
- **Impact**: Tests will be slower but more accurate
- **Solution**: Performance monitoring implemented, container pooling planned for Phase 2

### Cleanup Requirements
- **Constraint**: Zero orphaned containers mandate
- **Impact**: Critical for development environment health
- **Solution**: Multi-layer cleanup strategy with verification tools

## 📊 PHASE 1 SUCCESS METRICS

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Zero compilation errors | 100% | ✅ ACHIEVED |
| Container startup monitoring | <5 sec target | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
| Cleanup time monitoring | <30 sec target | ✅ IMPLEMENTED |
