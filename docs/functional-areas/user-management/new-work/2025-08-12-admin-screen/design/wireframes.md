<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-12 -->
<!-- Version: 2.0 -->
<!-- Owner: UI Designer Agent -->
<!-- Status: Updated per Stakeholder Feedback -->

## Design Overview

The User Management Admin Screen Redesign provides a comprehensive interface for administrators to manage community members efficiently. The design prioritizes desktop workflows (1920x1080) with dense information display, streamlined filtering, and integrated administrative actions. **Updated to include admin navigation structure and simplified user flows based on critical stakeholder feedback.**

### User Goals
- Navigate efficiently through admin areas with consistent left navigation
- Quickly find and filter users with above-table search/filter controls
- Access detailed user information with integrated notes and actions
- Perform administrative actions without complex modal workflows
- Manage vetting processes with streamlined tab interface

## User Personas

- **Admin**: System administrators managing platform with full access to all user management functions
- **Event Organizer**: Limited admin access focused on event-related user management
- **Super Admin**: Enhanced permissions for sensitive operations like permanent deletions

## Admin Layout Structure

The admin area features a consistent left navigation menu with main sections:
- **Dashboard**: Admin overview and statistics
- **User Management**: Current user management interface
- **Event Management**: Event creation and oversight
- **Vetting Queue**: Dedicated vetting workflow area  
- **Reports**: Analytics and compliance reporting
- **Settings**: System configuration and admin preferences
