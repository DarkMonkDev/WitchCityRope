# Business Requirements: User Management Admin Screen Redesign
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-12 -->
<!-- Version: 2.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft - Updated with stakeholder UI/UX feedback -->

## Executive Summary

The current user management admin screen needs a complete redesign to address usability issues and functionality gaps identified through user feedback. This redesign will transform the current basic Bootstrap table implementation into a comprehensive, efficient admin tool that supports the unique needs of the WitchCityRope community management, focusing on simplified status management and streamlined admin workflows.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

The current user management admin screen at `/admin/users` has significant limitations:
- **Poor Visual Design**: Basic Bootstrap table lacks modern admin interface aesthetics
- **Complex Status Fields**: Separate "Status" and "Vetted" fields create confusion
- **Limited Functionality**: Missing advanced filtering and streamlined vetting workflow tools
- **Inefficient Workflow**: Admins struggle with vetting processes and member management tasks
- **Information Overload**: Too many columns and stats make the interface difficult to scan
- **Lack of Admin Notes**: No persistent note-taking system for member interactions

### Business Value

- **Increased Admin Efficiency**: 50% reduction in time spent on member management tasks
- **Simplified Status Management**: Single status field eliminates confusion
- **Improved User Experience**: Streamlined interface reduces training time
- **Better Community Safety**: Enhanced vetting workflow tools and audit capabilities
- **Scalability Support**: Handle growing community membership without admin bottlenecks
- **Better Member History Tracking**: Comprehensive view of member attendance and patterns

### Success Metrics

- Admin task completion time reduced by 50%
- 95% admin satisfaction score with new interface
- Support ticket reduction of 75% for user management issues
- Vetting process completion time reduced from 2 weeks to 1 week average

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Simplified User Management Interface

#### Story 1.1: Consolidated Status Management
**As an** Admin
**I want to** manage member status through a single, clear status field
**So that** I can quickly understand and update member vetting status without confusion

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm viewing the admin users page
- When I look at the user grid
- Then I see a single "Status" column with values: Pending Review, Vetted, No Application, On Hold, Banned
- And I can filter by any of these status values
- And I can sort by status to group similar members together
- And the status field uses color coding for quick visual identification
- And there is no separate "Vetted" field or column

#### Story 1.2: Focused User Statistics Dashboard
**As an** Admin
**I want to** see only the most important user statistics at the top of the page
**So that** I can quickly assess the current state of the community without information overload

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm on the user management page
- When the page loads
- Then I see exactly 3 top statistics: Total Users, Pending Vetting, On Hold
- And these stats update automatically when data changes
- And each stat shows the current count with clear labeling
- And clicking a stat filters the user grid to show those users

#### Story 1.3: Optimized User Grid Display
**As an** Admin
**I want to** view member information in a clean, scannable grid format
**So that** I can efficiently process and manage large numbers of community members

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm viewing the admin users page

- And there is no "Last Login" column in the default view
- And pagination shows 50 records per page by default
- And I can search across Scene Name, First Name, Last Name, and Email
- And the grid loads within 2 seconds for up to 1000 users

#### Story 1.4: Consistent Admin Navigation
**As an** Admin
**I want to** navigate between admin functions through a left sidebar menu
**So that** I have consistent navigation across all admin pages

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I'm on any admin page
- When I look at the navigation
- Then I see a left sidebar with: Dashboard, User Management, Event Management, Vetting Queue, Reports, Settings
- And the current page is highlighted in the navigation
- And clicking any menu item navigates to that admin section
- And the navigation is consistent across all admin pages

### Epic 2: Streamlined User Detail Management

#### Story 2.1: Simplified User Profile View
**As an** Admin
**I want to** view a complete profile for any community member with clear information hierarchy
**So that** I can quickly access the information I need for decision making

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I click on a user in the data grid
- When I navigate to their detail page
- Then I see First Name and Last Name displayed prominently at the top
- And I see the Overview content visible by default (not hidden in a tab)

- And quick actions include: Edit User, Change Status, View Events, Add Note
- And there are no "Export Data" or "Send Message" actions

#### Story 2.2: Always-Visible Admin Notes Panel
**As an** Admin

- And I can scroll through historical notes
- And notes are only visible to admins and event organizers
- And all note additions/edits are audit logged

#### Story 2.3: Edit User Modal for Profile Updates
**As an** Admin

- When I click "Edit User" in the quick actions
- Then a modal opens with editable profile fields
- And I can update First Name, Last Name, Email, Scene Name, and Role

## Business Rules

### Status Management Rules
1. **Single Status Field**: All member status is managed through one consolidated Status field
2. **Status Values**: Only these values are allowed: Pending Review, Vetted, No Application, On Hold, Banned
3. **Status Transitions**: Only specific status transitions are allowed (e.g., No Application → Pending Review → Vetted)
4. **Admin Authority**: Only Admins can change status through this interface
5. **Audit Trail Required**: All status changes must be logged with timestamp, admin identity, and reason

### User Interface Rules
1. **Admin Navigation**: Left sidebar navigation must be consistent across all admin pages
2. **Grid Pagination**: Default to 50 records per page for optimal performance
3. **Required Columns**: Scene Name, First Name, Last Name, Email, Status, Role are mandatory columns
4. **Notes Panel**: Admin notes panel must be always visible on user detail pages

## Examples/Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Member Vetting with Simplified Status (Happy Path)
1. Admin receives notification of new vetting application
2. Admin opens user management page and sees "Pending Review" status in grid
3. Admin clicks on member to view detail page
4. Reviews application materials in Overview tab (visible by default)
5. Adds admin note in always-visible right panel about initial assessment
6. Uses quick action to change status from "Pending Review" to "Vetted"
7. System automatically sends welcome email via SendGrid
8. Admin notes persist in right panel for future reference
9. Audit trail records status change with timestamp

### Scenario 2: Member Status Review with Simplified Interface
1. Admin needs to review a member due to incident report
2. Opens user management screen with new left navigation
3. Searches for member using First Name or Scene Name
4. Views member's profile with prominent name display
5. Reviews all admin notes in always-visible right panel
6. Checks attendance patterns in Events tab
7. Adds new admin note documenting the current situation
8. Changes status to "On Hold" using quick action if needed
9. System logs status change and sends notification email

### Scenario 3: Using New Statistics Dashboard
1. Admin arrives at user management page
2. Views top 3 statistics: Total Users (145), Pending Vetting (8), On Hold (2)
3. Clicks "Pending Vetting" stat to filter grid to show only those 8 members
4. Processes each pending member using simplified status workflow
5. Returns to main grid view to see updated statistics

## Questions for Product Manager

- [ ] **Status Migration**: How should existing "Vetted" true/false values be migrated to new Status field?
- [ ] **Communication Integration**: Should SendGrid templates be pre-configured for each status change?
- [ ] **Navigation Integration**: Should left sidebar navigation be implemented first as a separate phase?
- [ ] **Note Categories**: Should admin notes be categorized (vetting, behavior, general, etc.)?
- [ ] **Search Scope**: Should admin note content be searchable across all members?
- [ ] **Mobile Experience**: What level of mobile support is required for the admin interface?
