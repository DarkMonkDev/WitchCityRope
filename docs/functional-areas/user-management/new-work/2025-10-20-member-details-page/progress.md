## Workflow Information
**Type**: Feature Development
**Start Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Phase 3 - Implementation (Skipping Phases 1-2 per user request)
**Quality Gates**: R:N/A D:N/A I:0% → 85% T:0% → 100%

## Feature Summary
Admin-facing member details page with tabbed interface mirroring event details page layout:
- **Tab 1**: Contact info, notes, vetting notes, role assignment, status management, participation summary

## Phase 2: Design (SKIPPED)
**Status**: SKIPPED - Direct implementation requested
**Progress**: N/A
**Skipped Reason**: Using existing event details page design as template

## Phase 3: Implementation
**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Ready to Start
**Progress**: 0%
**Started**: 2025-10-20
**Target Completion**: TBD
