# Agent Responsibility Matrix for Git Worktrees
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-22 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Librarian Agent -->
<!-- Status: Active -->

## üî¥ CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: Worktrees ARE Branches üî¥

**EVERY AGENT MUST UNDERSTAND:**
- A worktree IS the branch - not a copy of a branch
- When git-manager creates a worktree, it creates THE branch in its own directory
- The branch exists ONLY in the worktree directory
- The main repo NEVER switches branches - it stays on development/master
- Removing the worktree removes the branch entirely

### ‚ùå WRONG Mental Model:
"Create a branch, then create a worktree from it" - NO! This is redundant!

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Mental Model:
"Create a worktree AS the branch" - The worktree IS where the branch lives!

## Executive Summary

This document defines the responsibility matrix for git worktree management across all AI agents in the WitchCityRope development workflow. It establishes clear ownership boundaries, prevents conflicts, and ensures coordinated worktree lifecycle management. All agents must understand that worktrees ARE branches, not copies.

## Primary Responsibility Matrix

### Core Worktree Operations

| Operation | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | Backup Agent | Forbidden Agents |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Create Worktrees (AS branches)** | git-manager | - | orchestrator | ALL others |
| **Manage Worktrees (THE branches)** | git-manager | librarian (docs) | orchestrator | ALL development agents |
| **Clean Up Worktrees (removes branches)** | git-manager | - | orchestrator | ALL others |
| **Monitor Worktrees** | git-manager | librarian (registry) | orchestrator | ALL others |

### Supporting Operations

| Operation | Primary Agent | Secondary Agent | Coordination Required |
|-----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Environment Setup** | git-manager | - | With orchestrator |
| **Documentation Tracking** | librarian | git-manager | File registry updates |
| **Status Reporting** | git-manager | orchestrator | Progress coordination |
| **Error Recovery** | git-manager | orchestrator | User escalation |

## Detailed Agent Responsibilities

### Git Manager Agent (PRIMARY OWNER)

#### Core Responsibilities
1. **Worktree Creation (Creates THE Branch)**
   - Create THE branch AS a worktree (not from a branch, AS the branch!)
   - Use command: `git worktree add ../path -b branch-name` (creates branch IN worktree)
   - Set up environment files (.env.local, .env)
   - Install Node.js dependencies (npm install)
   - Verify environment functionality
   - Report creation success to orchestrator

2. **Worktree Management**
   - Monitor all active worktrees
   - Track branch-to-worktree relationships
   - Manage worktree status and health
   - Coordinate with librarian for documentation

3. **MANDATORY Cleanup Operations** (Phase 5 Finalization)
   - Detect merged branches requiring IMMEDIATE cleanup
   - Remove worktrees as part of workflow completion
   - Clean up associated directories and files
   - Update git repository state
   - Report cleanup completion BEFORE workflow ends

4. **Environment Synchronization**
   - Ensure environment files are current across worktrees
   - Update worktrees when main environment changes
   - Validate environment consistency

#### Specific Functions

##### Worktree Creation Function
```bash
# Function: create_ai_worktree
# Purpose: Creates THE branch AS a worktree (branch exists ONLY in worktree)
# Command: git worktree add ../path -b branch-name (ONE command creates both!)
# Input: branch-name, work-type (feature|bugfix|hotfix)
# Output: worktree path (where THE branch lives), environment status, ready signal
# Dependencies: main repo access (stays on development), environment files
```

##### Worktree Status Function
```bash
# Function: list_worktree_status
# Output: active worktrees, associated branches, disk usage, cleanup candidates
# Dependencies: git worktree list, branch analysis
```

##### MANDATORY Cleanup Function (Phase 5)
```bash
# Function: cleanup_merged_worktrees_finalization
# Purpose: Remove worktree (which removes THE branch - it only existed there!)
# Command: git worktree remove ../path (removes BOTH worktree AND branch)
# Trigger: Part of Phase 5 workflow completion
# Input: branch name, merge confirmation
# Output: cleanup success/failure, branch gone, directory removed
# Dependencies: merge detection, safety verification, workflow completion
```

#### Coordination Requirements
- **With Orchestrator**: Receive worktree creation requests, report status
- **With Librarian**: Provide worktree information for file registry
- **With Development Agents**: Verify working directories, provide environment status

### Orchestrator (COORDINATION OWNER)

#### Core Responsibilities
1. **Worktree Workflow Integration**
   - Request worktree creation from git-manager (creates THE branch AS worktree)
   - Understand: the branch lives ONLY in that worktree directory
   - Coordinate agent working directories (where branches live)
   - Manage worktree context in delegations
   - Trigger cleanup after successful merges (removes branch AND worktree)

2. **Agent Coordination**
   - Pass worktree context to all delegated agents
   - Verify agents are working in correct worktrees
   - Coordinate parallel development in separate worktrees
   - Manage workflow state across worktrees

3. **Quality Gate Enforcement**
   - Verify environment setup before proceeding
   - Ensure proper isolation between work streams
   - Validate cleanup completion
   - Monitor worktree health during workflow

#### Delegation Patterns

##### Standard Delegation with Worktree Context
```markdown
Task: [agent-name]
Prompt: [specific instructions]

Worktree Context:
- Working Directory: /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-worktrees/[worktree-name]
- Branch: [branch-name] (exists ONLY in this worktree directory!)
- Main Repo: Stays on development/master (NEVER switches branches)
- Environment: [environment-status]

Required Verification:
- Confirm working directory before starting
- Verify environment files present
- Check dependencies installed
```

##### Environment Verification Delegation
```markdown
Task: git-manager
Prompt: Verify worktree environment for [worktree-name]

Required Checks:
- Environment files (.env.local, .env)
- Node.js dependencies (package.json, node_modules)
- Database connection configuration
- Docker configuration if applicable
```

### Librarian Agent (DOCUMENTATION OWNER)

#### Core Responsibilities
1. **Worktree Documentation Management**
   - Track worktree creation in file registry
   - Document worktree lifecycle events
   - Maintain worktree-to-documentation relationships
   - Update functional area documentation

2. **File Registry Maintenance**
   - Log all worktree operations in file registry
   - Track files created/modified in each worktree
   - Document cleanup activities
   - Maintain worktree history

3. **Cross-Worktree Documentation**
   - Ensure documentation consistency across worktrees
   - Manage shared documentation updates
   - Coordinate documentation merges
   - Archive worktree-specific documentation

#### File Registry Updates Required

##### Worktree Creation Entry
```markdown
| Date | File Path | Action | Purpose | Session/Task | Status | Cleanup Date |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | /worktrees/[name]/ | WORKTREE_CREATED | [Feature description] | [Task] | ACTIVE | [Merge date] |
```

##### Worktree Cleanup Entry
```markdown
| Date | File Path | Action | Purpose | Session/Task | Status | Cleanup Date |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | /worktrees/[name]/ | WORKTREE_REMOVED | Merged to main | Cleanup | ARCHIVED | YYYY-MM-DD |
```
