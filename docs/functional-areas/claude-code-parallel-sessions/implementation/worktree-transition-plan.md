# Git Worktree Transition Implementation Plan
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-22 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Librarian Agent -->
<!-- Status: Active -->

## 🔴 CRITICAL CONCEPT: Worktrees ARE Branches! 🔴

**UNDERSTAND THIS FIRST:**
- A worktree IS the branch - not a copy of a branch
- When you create a worktree, you create THE branch in its own directory
- The branch exists ONLY in the worktree directory
- The main repo NEVER switches branches - it stays on development/master
- Removing the worktree removes the branch entirely

### ❌ WRONG Mental Model:
"Create a branch, then create a worktree from it" - NO! This is redundant!

### ✅ CORRECT Mental Model:
"Create a worktree AS the branch" - The worktree IS where the branch lives!

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for transitioning the AI development workflow from using git branches in the same directory to using git worktrees. This transition is specifically designed for AI agents (not human developers) and addresses the critical concern of proper cleanup of worktree folders after work is merged

**Key Deliverables:**
- 5-phase implementation approach
- Current branch migration strategy (3 merged, 1 unmerged)
- Agent responsibility assignments
- Automated cleanup process design
- Complete workflow documentation updates

## Phase 1: Preparation (2-3 days)

- Node.js dependency management
- Database connection configuration

## Phase 2: Current Branch Migration Strategy (1 day)

### Timing: After Current Development Completes

**CRITICAL**: This migration MUST wait until all current development on existing branches is complete and merged to avoid disruption.

### Pre-Migration Assessment

#### 2.1 Branch Inventory
**Current Branch Status:**
- **3 MERGED BRANCHES**: Ready for migration to worktree history
- **1 UNMERGED BRANCH**: `feature/2025-08-12-user-management-redesign` (requires active migration)
- **CURRENT BRANCH**: `feature/2025-08-22-api-architecture-modernization` (ready for merge)

#### 2.2 Migration Decision Matrix
For each existing branch:

| Branch | Status | Action | Rationale |
|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Active Development | In progress | Wait, then convert | Minimize disruption |
| Ready for Merge | Complete | Merge first, then archive | Clean slate |
| Experimental | Testing | Archive or convert | Based on value |
| Hotfix | Critical | Special handling | Priority conversion |

### Migration Steps for Each Branch

#### 2.3 Standard Migration Process
For each branch identified:

1. **Assessment Phase**
   ```bash
   # Check branch status
   git status
   git log --oneline -10
   git diff main..branch-name --stat
   ```

2. **Decision Point**
   - If actively developed: Convert to worktree
   - If ready for merge: Merge to main first
   - If experimental: Archive or convert based on value

3. **Conversion Process** (For branches to convert)
   ```bash
   # For existing branch - move THE branch to a worktree (branch now lives ONLY in worktree)
   git worktree add ../witchcityrope-worktrees/[branch-name] [branch-name]
   
   # Setup environment in worktree
   cd ../witchcityrope-worktrees/[branch-name]
   cp ../../witchcityrope-react/.env.local . 2>/dev/null || true
   npm install
   ```

4. **Verification**
   - Verify all files present
   - Verify environment works
   - Test basic functionality

5. **Note About Branch Location**
   ```bash
   # The branch now exists ONLY in the worktree directory
   # No need to delete from main repo - it's not there anymore!
   # The branch IS the worktree now
   ```

### Migration Rollback Plan

#### 2.4 Recovery Procedures
If migration encounters issues:

1. **Branch Recreation**
   ```bash
   # Recreate original branch if needed
   git checkout -b [branch-name] [last-known-good-commit]
   ```

2. **Worktree Removal**
   ```bash
   # Remove problematic worktree
   git worktree remove ../witchcityrope-worktrees/[branch-name]
   ```

3. **Documentation Update**
   - Log migration issues in librarian lessons learned
   - Update migration procedures based on learnings

## Phase 3: Worktree Implementation (3-4 days)

### Step-by-Step Implementation Process

#### 3.1 Directory Structure Creation
**Responsibility**: Git Manager Agent

**Directory Structure:**
```
/home/chad/repos/
├── witchcityrope-react/              # Main repository
└── witchcityrope-worktrees/          # Worktrees directory
    ├── feature-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[name]/  # Feature development
    ├── bugfix-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[name]/   # Bug fixes
    ├── enhancement-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[name]/ # UI improvements
    └── hotfix-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[name]/   # Emergency fixes
```

#### 3.2 Agent Implementation Assignments

##### 3.2.1 Git Manager Agent Implementation
**File**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/.claude/agents/utility/git-manager.md`

**New Functions to Implement:**
1. **Worktree Creation Function**
   - Create THE branch AS a worktree (not from a branch, AS the branch!)
   - Automated directory naming
   - Environment file copying
   - Dependency installation
   - Verification procedures

2. **Worktree Status Function**
   - List all active worktrees
   - Show status of each worktree
   - Identify stale worktrees

3. **Worktree Cleanup Function**
   - Identify merged branches
   - Remove corresponding worktrees
   - Clean up environment files

##### 3.2.2 Orchestrator Integration
**File**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/.claude/commands/orchestrate.md`

**Integration Points:**
1. **Initialization Phase Update**
   - Replace `git checkout -b` with worktree creation delegation (creates THE branch AS a worktree)
   - NEVER switch branches in main repo (it stays on development/master)
   - Add environment setup verification
   - Update documentation folder creation

2. **Delegation Enhancement**
   - Pass worktree context to all agents
   - Include working directory in all prompts
   - Verify agent working directory awareness

3. **Finalization Phase Update**
   - Add cleanup delegation to git-manager
   - Verify all changes committed
   - Coordinate worktree removal after merge

##### 3.2.3 Development Agent Updates
**Agents**: react-developer, backend-developer, test-developer

**Required Updates:**
1. **Working Directory Awareness**
   - Always verify current working directory
   - Check for correct environment files
   - Validate dependency installation

2. **Environment Verification**
   - Check for proper .env files
   - Verify database connections
   - Validate Docker configurations

### Automation Scripts Needed

#### 3.3 Worktree Management Scripts
**Location**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/scripts/worktree/`

##### 3.3.1 Creation Script
**File**: `create-worktree.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Create new worktree with full environment setup
# Usage: ./create-worktree.sh <branch-name>
```

##### 3.3.2 Status Script
**File**: `worktree-status.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Show status of all worktrees
# Identify stale or ready-to-cleanup worktrees
```

##### 3.3.3 Cleanup Script
**File**: `cleanup-worktrees.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Remove worktrees for merged branches
# Clean up environment files and directories
```

#### 3.4 Agent Integration Scripts
**Location**: `/.claude/scripts/`

##### 3.4.1 Agent Environment Setup
**File**: `setup-agent-environment.sh`
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Verify agent working directory
# Check environment files
# Validate dependencies
```

## Phase 4: Cleanup Process Design

### Cleanup Responsibility Recommendation: **Git Manager Agent**

#### 4.1 Rationale for Git Manager Ownership

**Advantages:**
1. **Domain Expertise**: Git operations are core git-manager responsibility
2. **Workflow Integration**: Already handles branch lifecycle management
3. **Centralized Control**: Single point of responsibility for git state
4. **Existing Knowledge**: Already understands branch-to-main merge patterns

**vs. Librarian Ownership:**
- **Librarian Focus**: File organization, not git operations
- **Domain Separation**: Git operations should stay with git specialist
- **Complexity**: Would require librarian to learn git worktree internals

#### 4.2 Cleanup Workflow After PR Merge

##### 4.2.1 Trigger Points
**MANDATORY Cleanup Triggers:**
1. **IMMEDIATE AFTER MERGE**: Part of Phase 5 finalization workflow
2. **Manual Trigger**: When git-manager detects merged branches
3. **NO SCHEDULED CLEANUP**: Cleanup happens during workflow completion ONLY

##### 4.2.2 Cleanup Process Steps
1. **Merge Detection**
   ```bash
   # Identify merged branches
   git branch --merged main | grep -E "(feature|bugfix|hotfix)/"
   ```

2. **Worktree Verification**
   ```bash
   # Verify corresponding worktree exists
   git worktree list | grep [branch-name]
   ```

3. **Safety Checks**
   - Verify branch is actually merged
   - Check for uncommitted changes in worktree
   - Confirm no active processes in worktree

4. **MANDATORY Cleanup Execution** (Phase 5 Finalization)
   ```bash
   # Remove worktree IMMEDIATELY after PR merge (this removes THE branch too!)
   git worktree remove ../witchcityrope-worktrees/[worktree-name]
   
   # Branch is already gone - it existed ONLY in the worktree!
   # No separate branch deletion needed
   ```

5. **Documentation Update**
   - Log cleanup in file registry
   - Report cleanup completion to orchestrator
   - WORKFLOW CANNOT COMPLETE until cleanup verified

### Preventing Folder Accumulation

#### 4.3 Prevention Strategies

##### 4.3.1 Automated Monitoring
**Implementation**: Git Manager Agent daily check
- Monitor worktree directory size
- Count number of active worktrees
- Alert when thresholds exceeded

**Prevention Thresholds:**
- **Target**: <3 active worktrees (immediate cleanup prevents accumulation)
- **Warning**: >5 active worktrees (indicates cleanup failures)
- **Critical**: >10 active worktrees (emergency cleanup required)

##### 4.3.2 Proactive Cleanup
**Workflow Finalization Tasks:**
1. **Immediate Post-Merge Cleanup** (MANDATORY)
   - Remove worktree within minutes of merge
   - No accumulation allowed
   - Part of Phase 5 completion requirements

2. **Orphaned Worktree Detection** (As needed)
   - Find worktrees without corresponding branches
   - Identify corrupted worktree states
   - Manual cleanup with safety checks

##### 4.3.3 Emergency Cleanup Procedures
**When Cleanup Fails:**
1. **Manual Intervention Protocol**
   - Document the failure
   - Provide manual cleanup steps
   - Update automation to prevent recurrence

2. **Force Cleanup (Last Resort)**
   ```bash
   # Force remove worktree directory
   rm -rf ../witchcityrope-worktrees/[worktree-name]
   git worktree prune
   ```
