## Executive Summary
**Decision Required**: How to properly manage multiple Claude Code sessions for parallel development without git branch context sharing
**Primary Finding**: Git worktrees are the industry-standard solution for isolating Claude Code sessions
**Key Discovery**: Claude Code sessions share git context through the file system because they all operate in the same working directory

## Research Scope
### Requirements
- Understand why Claude Code sessions share git branch context
- Evaluate git worktrees as the primary solution
- Document performance and complexity implications
- Provide implementation guidance for parallel development workflows

### Success Criteria
- Technical mechanism for branch sharing identified and documented
- Git worktree capabilities and limitations thoroughly analyzed
- Working parallel session setup demonstrated and validated
- Clear recommendations for changing current workflow

## Technical Root Cause Analysis

### Why Claude Code Sessions Share Git Context
Based on research from official Anthropic documentation and community sources published in 2025:

**Core Technical Mechanism**:
- Claude Code sessions operate in the same working directory and inherit the bash environment
- Git state (current branch, index, working tree) is stored in the file system shared by all processes
- When one Claude Code session switches branches using `git checkout`, it changes the `.git/HEAD` file and working directory files
- All other sessions in the same directory immediately see this change because they share the same file system view

**File System Level Sharing**:
- `.git/HEAD` file contains the current branch reference
- `.git/index` file contains staged changes
- Working directory files reflect the current checked-out branch
- All Claude Code sessions in the same directory access these shared files

**Quote from Anthropic Documentation**: "Claude Code inherits your bash environment, which means it can access your git context and tools."

### How Git Worktrees Solve the Problem

**Technical Implementation**:
- Git worktrees create separate working directories for different branches
- Each worktree has its own `.git` file pointing to the main repository
- The main `.git` directory is shared for history and objects, but working state is isolated
- Each Claude Code session operates in its own worktree directory with independent file system state

**Isolation Mechanism**:
- **Shared**: Git history, objects, remotes, configuration
- **Isolated**: Working directory files, index (staging area), HEAD reference, local branches

## Technology Options Evaluated

### Option 1: Git Worktrees (Recommended Solution)
**Overview**: Use git worktrees to create isolated working directories for parallel development
**Industry Adoption**: Standard solution adopted by major development teams (incident.io, GitButler, etc.)
**Documentation Quality**: Comprehensive with extensive community support

**Pros**:
- **Complete Session Isolation**: Each Claude Code session operates in its own working directory
- **Shared Git History**: All worktrees share the same repository database and history
- **Minimal Performance Overhead**: Git 2.37+ optimized worktree performance (Stack Overflow: "shouldn't impact performance negatively in any meaningful way")
- **Disk Space Efficient**: Shares .git directory, only duplicates working files
- **Industry Standard**: Widely adopted solution with proven track record
- **Native Git Feature**: Built into Git since 2015, mature and stable

**Cons**:
- **Setup Overhead**: Requires creating and managing multiple directories
- **Environment Duplication**: Need to install dependencies and copy config files for each worktree
- **Learning Curve**: Teams need to understand worktree concepts and commands
- **Directory Management**: Need to organize and clean up worktree directories

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- **Safety/Privacy**: Excellent - no security implications
- **Mobile Experience**: N/A - development tool only
- **Learning Curve**: Medium - requires team training on worktree concepts
- **Community Values**: Excellent - uses open source Git features

**Performance Data**:
- **Disk Space**: Saves space vs multiple clones (shares .git directory)
- **Git Operations**: Minimal overhead in Git 2.37+ (previous versions had fetch performance issues)
- **Memory Usage**: Each worktree uses standard working directory memory

### Option 2: GitButler Integration (Alternative Approach)
**Overview**: Use GitButler with Claude Code lifecycle hooks for automatic branch management
**Version Evaluated**: GitButler latest release (August 2025)
**Documentation Quality**: Good with specific integration guides

**Pros**:
- **Automatic Branch Management**: Creates branches automatically for each session
- **No Worktree Complexity**: Operates in single working directory
- **Lifecycle Hook Integration**: Uses Claude Code's new lifecycle hooks for automation
- **Clean Branch Separation**: "Write three features, get three clean branches â€” no conflicts, no worktrees, no hassle"

**Cons**:
- **Additional Tool Dependency**: Requires GitButler installation and configuration
- **Still Single Working Directory**: Multiple sessions still share file system state
- **Limited Control**: Less granular control over session isolation
- **Newer Technology**: Less mature than git worktrees

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- **Safety/Privacy**: Good - adds another tool dependency
- **Mobile Experience**: N/A - development tool only
- **Learning Curve**: Medium - requires GitButler knowledge
- **Community Values**: Good - but adds complexity

### Option 3: Crystal Desktop Application (GUI Solution)
**Overview**: Desktop application that manages multiple Claude Code sessions with git worktrees
**Version Evaluated**: Latest release (August 2025)
**Documentation Quality**: Good with GitHub documentation

**Pros**:
- **GUI Interface**: Visual management of parallel sessions
- **Automated Worktree Management**: Handles worktree creation and cleanup
- **Session Persistence**: Resume conversations anytime
- **Built-in Git Operations**: Rebase and squash operations integrated

**Cons**:
- **GUI Dependency**: Requires desktop application vs terminal-native workflow
- **Additional Complexity**: Another tool to learn and maintain
- **Platform Dependency**: May not work on all development environments

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- **Safety/Privacy**: Good - desktop application
- **Mobile Experience**: N/A - development tool only
- **Learning Curve**: High - new application with GUI
- **Community Values**: Medium - adds proprietary tooling layer

## Implementation Considerations

### Migration Path for WitchCityRope Team
**Step 1: Team Training** (1 day)
- Educate team on git worktree concepts and commands
- Practice creating and managing worktrees in test repository
- Establish naming conventions and directory structure

**Step 2: Workflow Setup** (2-3 days)
```bash
# Create worktrees directory structure
mkdir -p ~/projects/witchcityrope-worktrees

# Create worktrees for parallel development
git worktree add ~/projects/witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-authentication feature/authentication
git worktree add ~/projects/witchcityrope-worktrees/bugfix-validation bugfix/validation
git worktree add ~/projects/witchcityrope-worktrees/enhancement-ui enhancement/ui

# Setup automation script
cat > ~/bin/create-worktree << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
BRANCH_NAME=$1
WORKTREE_DIR=~/projects/witchcityrope-worktrees/$BRANCH_NAME
git worktree add $WORKTREE_DIR $BRANCH_NAME
cd $WORKTREE_DIR
# Copy environment files
cp ~/repos/witchcityrope-react/.env.local .
# Install dependencies
npm install
echo "Worktree created at $WORKTREE_DIR"
EOF
chmod +x ~/bin/create-worktree
```

**Step 3: Environment Automation** (1 day)
- Create scripts to copy .env files and install dependencies
- Automate port management for parallel development servers
- Set up worktree cleanup procedures

### Integration Points
**Docker Development**: Each worktree can run its own Docker containers on different ports
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Feature development
cd ~/projects/witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-authentication
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --scale web=1 --scale api=1
# Ports: web:5173, api:5653

# Terminal 2 - Bug fix
cd ~/projects/witchcityrope-worktrees/bugfix-validation  
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --scale web=1 --scale api=1 -p validation
# Ports: web:5174, api:5654
```

**Testing Strategy**: Each worktree maintains independent test runs
- Unit tests run in isolation per worktree
- E2E tests can run on different port configurations
- No test interference between parallel sessions

### Performance Impact
**Disk Space Analysis**:
- **Current Single Directory**: ~2GB (React app + node_modules + .git)
- **Three Worktrees**: ~5GB total (3x working files + 1x shared .git)
- **Savings vs Clones**: Would be ~8GB for 3 full clones

**Memory Usage**:
- Each Claude Code session: ~200-500MB
- Each development server: ~100-200MB
- Multiple sessions sustainable on 16GB+ machines

**Network/Build Performance**:
- No impact on network operations (shared .git)
- Each worktree requires separate npm install (~1-2 minutes)
- Hot reload performance unchanged per session

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Team Adoption Resistance**: Developers may resist changing workflow
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training and gradual rollout with champions

### Medium Risk
- **Disk Space Constraints**: Multiple worktrees use more disk space
  - **Mitigation**: Regular cleanup of unused worktrees, disk monitoring
- **Environment Synchronization**: Need to keep config files in sync across worktrees
  - **Mitigation**: Automation scripts for environment setup and updates

### Low Risk
- **Git Performance**: Minimal performance impact with modern Git versions
  - **Monitoring**: Track git operation performance, upgrade to Git 2.37+ if needed
- **Port Conflicts**: Multiple development servers may conflict
  - **Mitigation**: Port management automation and documentation
