# Claude Code Parallel Session Management Research Plan

<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-22 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Librarian Agent -->
<!-- Status: Active Research -->

## Executive Summary

This research investigates why two Claude Code sessions running in different terminal windows on the same codebase appear to share git branch context when they should be isolated. The primary hypothesis is that Claude Code sessions share git state through the file system, and git worktrees may provide the solution for true parallel development.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Research Questions
1. **Git Context Sharing**: Why do multiple Claude Code sessions see the same git branch context?
2. **Session Isolation**: What mechanisms exist to isolate Claude Code sessions from each other?
3. **Git Worktrees Viability**: Can git worktrees provide effective parallel session management?
4. **Best Practices**: What are optimal workflows for running multiple Claude Code sessions?

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Understand the technical mechanism causing shared git context
- [ ] Evaluate git worktrees as a solution with concrete pros/cons
