## Technical Architecture

### Service Architecture Pattern
```csharp
public class DatabaseInitializationService : BackgroundService
{
    // Milan Jovanovic fail-fast patterns
    // IHostedService integration for startup coordination
    // Polly retry policies for container startup delays
    // Comprehensive error classification and recovery guidance
}

public class SeedDataService : ISeedDataService
{
    // Transaction-based consistency with rollback capability
    // Idempotent operations safe for repeated execution
    // ASP.NET Core Identity integration for test accounts
    // Realistic test data with proper UTC DateTime handling
}
```

### Configuration Options
```json
{
  "DatabaseInitialization": {
    "EnableAutoMigration": true,
    "EnableSeedData": true,
    "TimeoutSeconds": 30,
    "FailOnSeedDataError": true,
    "ExcludedEnvironments": ["Production"],
    "MaxRetryAttempts": 3,
    "RetryDelaySeconds": 2.0,
    "EnableHealthChecks": true
  }
}
```

### Environment Behavior
- **Development**: Full migrations + comprehensive seed data
- **Staging**: Full migrations + comprehensive seed data  
- **Testing**: Full migrations + comprehensive seed data
- **Production**: Migrations only (seed data excluded for safety)

1. **Phase 1**: Apply pending EF Core migrations with retry policies
2. **Phase 2**: Populate seed data (environment-dependent)
3. **Monitoring**: Structured logging with correlation IDs and performance metrics
4. **Health Check**: Initialization status available at `/api/health/database`
