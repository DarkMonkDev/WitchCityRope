# Business Requirements: Database Auto-Initialization
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-22 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary
The WitchCityRope React application requires an automated database initialization system that eliminates manual setup steps for developers and ensures consistent database state across all environments. This feature will automatically apply Entity Framework migrations and populate seed data on API startup, transforming the current manual 4-step process into a seamless developer experience.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
**Current State Analysis**: The WitchCityRope application currently requires extensive manual database setup that creates friction in the development workflow and increases onboarding complexity.

**Current Manual Process (4 Steps)**:
1. Manual execution of Entity Framework migrations via `dotnet ef database update`
2. Manual execution of seed data scripts
3. Manual verification of database schema and data
4. Manual troubleshooting when environment setup fails

**Business Impact**:
- New developers spend 2-4 hours on database setup during onboarding
- Inconsistent database states between development environments
- Events display "(Fallback)" when database is empty, confusing stakeholders during demos
- Development productivity reduced by environment configuration issues
- Higher support burden for development team

### Business Value
- **Developer Productivity**: Eliminate 2-4 hours of manual setup per developer
- **Consistent Demo Environment**: Ensure proper data display during stakeholder presentations
- **Reduced Support Burden**: Eliminate environment-related support tickets
- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can focus on feature development immediately
- **Quality Assurance**: Consistent seed data enables reproducible testing scenarios

### Success Metrics
- **Setup Time Reduction**: From 2-4 hours to <5 minutes for new environments
- **Zero Manual Steps**: Complete database readiness without developer intervention
- **100% Demo Reliability**: No "(Fallback)" events during presentations
- **Environment Consistency**: Identical seed data across all development environments
- **Developer Satisfaction**: Improved onboarding experience feedback

## User Stories

### Story 1: Automatic Database Initialization for New Developers
**As a** new developer joining the WitchCityRope team  
**I want to** run the application and have the database automatically initialized  
**So that** I can start developing features immediately without manual setup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I am a new developer with Docker installed
- When I run `./dev.sh` or `docker-compose up`
- Then the API automatically applies all pending migrations
- And the API automatically populates seed data if the database is empty
- And I can immediately access the application with working test accounts
- And events display properly without "(Fallback)" text

### Story 2: Consistent Development Environment
**As a** developer working on WitchCityRope features  
**I want to** have consistent seed data across environments  
**So that** my testing and development work is predictable and reproducible

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I reset my development database
- When the API starts up
- Then the same test accounts are always created with identical credentials
- And the same sample events are created with consistent data
- And vetting statuses are properly configured per documentation
- And I can reproduce test scenarios reliably

### Story 3: Safe Production Deployment
**As a** DevOps engineer deploying WitchCityRope  
**I want to** ensure database initialization only runs in development  
**So that** production data is never affected by seed data operations

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the application is running in Production environment
- When the API starts up
- Then migrations are applied automatically
- But seed data operations are completely skipped
- And no test accounts are created
- And existing production data remains untouched

### Story 4: Idempotent Operations
**As a** developer restarting the API during development  
**I want to** have safe database operations on every startup  
**So that** I don't have to worry about duplicate data or errors

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the database already contains seed data
- When I restart the API
- Then the initialization process detects existing data
- And no duplicate accounts or events are created
- And the API starts successfully without errors
- And existing data relationships remain intact

### Story 5: Error Handling and Diagnostics
**As a** developer troubleshooting database issues  
**I want to** receive clear feedback about initialization status  
**So that** I can quickly identify and resolve any problems

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the database initialization process encounters an error
- When I check the API logs
- Then I see detailed information about what failed
- And I receive guidance on how to resolve the issue
- And the API gracefully handles the error without crashing
- And I can retry the operation after fixing the problem

## Business Rules

### Environment-Based Behavior
1. **Development Environment**: Full database initialization including migrations and seed data
2. **Staging Environment**: Migrations only, no seed data population
3. **Production Environment**: Migrations only, with additional safety checks and no seed data
4. **Test Environment**: Full initialization with test-specific data isolation

### Data Population Rules
1. **Idempotent Operations**: All initialization operations must be safe to run multiple times
2. **Seed Data Detection**: System must detect existing seed data and skip population accordingly
3. **Test Account Standards**: All test accounts use password "Test123!" as documented
4. **Vetting Status Configuration**: Automatic vetting for Admin/Teacher roles, manual for others
5. **Event Data Requirements**: Include past and future events for comprehensive testing scenarios

### Migration Management Rules
1. **Automatic Application**: All pending migrations applied on startup in development
2. **UTC Compliance**: All DateTime values must be stored as UTC for PostgreSQL compatibility
3. **Schema Validation**: Verify database schema matches expected state after migrations
4. **Rollback Safety**: No automatic rollbacks - manual intervention required for failures

### Performance and Safety Rules
1. **Startup Time Limit**: Database initialization must complete within 30 seconds
2. **Connection Resilience**: Retry database connections with exponential backoff
3. **Lock Prevention**: Use database-level coordination to prevent concurrent initialization
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper disposal of database connections and resources

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- **Entity Framework Dependency**: Must work with existing EF Core and ApplicationDbContext
- **PostgreSQL Compatibility**: All operations must work with PostgreSQL 16
- **Docker Environment**: Must work within Docker Compose development setup
- **ASP.NET Core Integration**: Initialization must integrate with application startup pipeline
- **NSwag Compatibility**: Must not interfere with existing NSwag type generation process

### Business Constraints
- **Development Only**: Seed data population restricted to development environments
- **Existing Data Preservation**: Must not modify or delete existing production data
- **Security Standards**: Test accounts must follow documented security patterns
- **Community Standards**: Seed data must align with community values and safety protocols

### Assumptions
- **Docker Environment**: Developers use Docker Compose for local development
- **Database Access**: API has proper database connection configuration
- **Migration Files**: All necessary EF Core migration files exist and are valid
- **Seed Data Accuracy**: Documented seed data represents current business requirements
- **Environment Detection**: Application can reliably detect its runtime environment

## Security & Privacy Requirements

### Authentication and Authorization
- Test accounts must use documented credentials for consistency
- No hardcoded production credentials in seed data
- Proper role assignment according to documented user hierarchy
- Email verification tokens generated securely for test accounts

### Data Protection
- Legal names must be properly encrypted in seed data

- Incident reports in seed data must use fictional scenarios

### Environment Security
- Production environment detection must be foolproof
- Seed data operations must be completely disabled in production
- No debug information exposed in production logs
- Database connection security must match environment requirements

## Compliance Requirements

### Development Standards
- Follow existing UTC DateTime patterns per ApplicationDbContext.cs
- Maintain compatibility with PostgreSQL schema configuration
- Use established audit field patterns (CreatedAt, UpdatedAt)
- Align with existing Entity Framework conventions

### Data Retention
- Seed data must be clearly marked as test data
- Test accounts must follow documented naming conventions
- Event data must include realistic but fictional scenarios
- All seed data must be reproducible and version-controlled

### Documentation Standards
- Initialization process must be documented for team reference
- Error messages must provide actionable guidance
- Configuration options must be clearly documented
- Version compatibility must be tracked and maintained
