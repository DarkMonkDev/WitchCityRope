**Quality Assessment**: EXCELLENT - Production ready with zero failures  
**Recommendation**: APPROVED FOR IMMEDIATE FULL ROLLOUT

The database auto-initialization vertical slice implementation has been completed and successfully tested with outstanding results. All test accounts created, all sample events loaded, health checks responding correctly, and performance metrics significantly exceeding targets.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components Delivered
1. **DatabaseInitializationService** - BackgroundService pattern implementation
2. **SeedDataService** - Comprehensive test data management  
3. **Health Check Integration** - `/api/health/database` endpoint
4. **Controller Cleanup** - Removed fallback data from EventsController
5. **Automated Initialization** - Zero manual intervention required

### Technology Pattern Success
- **BackgroundService Integration**: Seamless startup integration with API service
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean service registration and lifecycle management
- **Health Check Implementation**: Standard .NET health check patterns
