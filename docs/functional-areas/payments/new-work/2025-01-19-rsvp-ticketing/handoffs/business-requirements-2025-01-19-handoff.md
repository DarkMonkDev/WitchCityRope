# AGENT HANDOFF DOCUMENT

## Phase: Business Requirements Analysis
## Date: 2025-09-19 (Final Stakeholder Approvals)
## Feature: RSVP and Ticketing System
## Version: 3.0 - APPROVED - Ready for Phase 2

## üö® CRITICAL BUSINESS RULES (MUST IMPLEMENT)

### 1. **RSVP SIMPLIFICATION**: One RSVP per user per event (only for themselves)
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Single RSVP per user per event, self-only
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Multi-person RSVPs or assigning spots to others
   - **FUTURE SCOPE**: Multi-person RSVPs may be added later

### 2. **Social Events Clarification**: NOT necessarily free - often have suggested donation
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Social events often have optional ticket purchases (suggested donation)
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Treating social events as completely free
   - **Implementation**: RSVP required (free), ticket purchase optional (paid)

### 3. **Ticket Terminology**: Call them "tickets" not "door entry tickets"
   - ‚úÖ Correct: "Purchase Ticket" for both classes and social events
   - ‚ùå Wrong: "Door entry tickets" or similar confusing terminology
   - **Consistency**: Same terminology across all event types

### 4. **Automatic RSVP**: Purchasing a ticket automatically adds RSVP
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Ticket purchase includes RSVP automatically
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Requiring separate RSVP step before ticket purchase
   - **Implementation**: Streamlined flow for ticket purchasers

### 5. **Refund Policy Consistency**: Same policy for classes and social event tickets
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Unified refund policy across all paid participation
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Different policies for different event types
   - **Implementation**: Single refund system handles all ticket types

### 6. **Canceled/Refunded Tracking**: Never delete, only mark as canceled
   - ‚úÖ Correct: RSVPs/tickets stay in system with status: canceled
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Deleting participation records when canceled
   - **Admin View**: Can see all canceled RSVPs and refunded tickets for liability tracking

### 7. **Role System Confirmation**: Roles DO stack (User can be Vetted + Teacher + Admin)
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Multiple roles can be assigned to single user
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Single role per user
   - **Access Pattern**: Higher roles inherit lower role permissions

### 8. **Banned Status**: Cannot RSVP or purchase anything
   - ‚úÖ Correct: Banned users blocked from all participation
   - ‚ùå Wrong: Allowing any form of event participation when banned
   - **Implementation**: Hard block at API level for banned users

### 9. **SendGrid Clarification**: Enhanced explanatory notes
   - **Sandbox Mode**: Validates API calls but doesn't send emails (dev testing)
   - **@sink.sendgrid.net**: Accepts then deletes emails (integration testing)
   - **Production**: Real email delivery with domain authentication

## üìç KEY DOCUMENTS TO READ

| Document | Path | Critical Sections |
|----------|------|-------------------|
| **APPROVED Business Requirements** | `/docs/functional-areas/payments/new-work/2025-01-19-rsvp-ticketing/requirements/business-requirements.md` | Version 3.0 - Final stakeholder approved |
| PayPal Integration Docs | `/docs/functional-areas/payment-paypal-venmo/` | Webhook implementation details |
| DTO Alignment Strategy | `/docs/architecture/react-migration/DTO-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md` | NSwag type generation requirements |
| Authentication Documentation | `/docs/functional-areas/authentication/` | BFF pattern with HTTP-only cookies |

## üö® SCOPE REMOVALS (Updated)

### Items Explicitly Removed from Scope:
- ‚ùå **Multi-person RSVPs**: Future scope only
- ‚ùå **Instructor compensation**: Not in scope for this feature
- ‚ùå **Insurance requirements**: Not in scope for this feature
- ‚ùå **Anonymous attendance tracking**: Changed to "actual attendance tracking"

## üö® SENDGRID INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS (Enhanced)

### Development Environment Safety (CRITICAL)
1. **Sandbox Mode Required**: Enable `sandbox_mode: { enable: true }` in development
   - **Purpose**: Validates request structure without sending real emails
   - **Behavior**: Uses SendGrid credits but prevents delivery
   - **Critical**: Essential for preventing accidental emails to test accounts

2. **Test Email Strategy**: Use @sink.sendgrid.net domain for development
   - **Purpose**: Accepts emails then immediately deletes them
   - **Example**: test-emails@sink.sendgrid.net
   - **Behavior**: No inbox delivery, safe for automated testing

3. **Environment Separation**: Different SendGrid API keys per environment
   - Development: Free SendGrid account with sandbox mode
   - Staging: Separate paid account for UAT
   - Production: Dedicated account with domain authentication

### Production Configuration Requirements
1. **Domain Authentication**: Configure SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
2. **Dedicated IP**: Consider for sender reputation management
3. **Template Management**: Create reusable email templates
4. **Monitoring**: Implement delivery rate and bounce tracking

## üö® KNOWN PITFALLS (Updated with New Requirements)

### 1. **RSVP Multi-person Violation**: Implementing 2-spot RSVPs
   - **Why it happens**: Previous requirements mentioned this feature
   - **How to avoid**: Implement single RSVP per user only
   - **Test**: User can only RSVP for themselves

### 2. **Social Event Oversimplification**: Treating as free-only
   - **Why it happens**: Assuming social events have no payment component
   - **How to avoid**: Implement optional ticket purchase for suggested donations
   - **Test**: Social events allow optional ticket purchase after RSVP

### 3. **Data Deletion on Cancel**: Removing participation records
   - **Why it happens**: Common pattern to clean up canceled records
   - **How to avoid**: Change status to "canceled", never delete
   - **Test**: Admin can view all canceled RSVPs and refunded tickets

### 4. **Role Exclusivity Error**: Single role per user implementation
   - **Why it happens**: Simplifying role management
   - **How to avoid**: Allow role stacking (Vetted + Teacher + Admin)
   - **Test**: User can have multiple roles simultaneously

### 5. **Banned User Bypass**: Allowing any participation when banned
   - **Why it happens**: Not checking banned status comprehensively
   - **How to avoid**: Hard block at API level for all participation
   - **Test**: Banned user cannot RSVP or purchase tickets

## üìß SENDGRID IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY (Enhanced)

### Phase 1: Development Setup (Enhanced Safety)
1. **Environment Configuration**
   ```bash
   SENDGRID_API_KEY_DEV=dev_key_here
   SENDGRID_SANDBOX_MODE=true
   SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=dev-test@sink.sendgrid.net
   ```

2. **Safety Measures (Critical)**
   - **Sandbox mode**: Validates but never sends emails
   - **Sink domain**: @sink.sendgrid.net accepts then deletes
   - **Environment isolation**: Separate keys for each environment
   - **Test prevention**: No real email addresses in development

### Phase 2: Template Creation
1. **RSVP Confirmation Template**
   - Event details, optional ticket purchase link
   - Calendar invite attachment
   - Cancellation policy information

2. **Ticket Purchase Confirmation Template**
   - Ticket details, payment confirmation
   - Unified experience for all ticket types
   - Refund policy (same for all events)

3. **Cancellation Template**
   - Confirmation of cancellation
   - Historical record maintenance notice
