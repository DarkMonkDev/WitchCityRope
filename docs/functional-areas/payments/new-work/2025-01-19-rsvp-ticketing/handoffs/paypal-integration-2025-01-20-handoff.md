## Technical Implementation Details

### PayPal Configuration
```typescript
// Environment Variables Required:
VITE_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=AaTUvkwNVutLN6ujfPHX7wk1lh0vndE3wAxZwM5-pTgS38-AJNheP2bYH_DmEr22wy5lVubJEL3dEXZI
VITE_PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox
```

### PayPal Order Flow
```typescript
// 1. User clicks "Purchase Ticket with PayPal"
// 2. PayPal button appears with payment summary
// 3. PayPal SDK creates order with event details
// 4. User completes payment on PayPal
// 5. Payment success triggers backend ticket creation
// 6. UI updates with participation status
```

### API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Payment confirmation flow
const confirmPayPalPayment = useConfirmPayPalPayment();

// On PayPal success
await confirmPayPalPayment.mutateAsync({
  orderId: paymentDetails.id,
  paymentDetails
});

// Calls backend: POST /api/events/{eventId}/tickets
// With PayPal order ID as payment method
```

## User Experience Flow

### Class Events (Ticket Purchase Required)
1. ✅ User visits class event detail page
2. ✅ Sees "Purchase Ticket with PayPal" button with suggested pricing
3. ✅ Clicks button → PayPal payment form appears
4. ✅ Reviews payment summary with sliding scale options
5. ✅ Completes PayPal checkout securely
6. ✅ Returns to event page with ticket confirmed
7. ✅ Receives toast notification of successful purchase

### Social Events (Free RSVP)
- ✅ RSVP flow unchanged - works as before
- ✅ Optional PayPal ticket purchase available for event support

## Testing Completed

### Manual Testing ✅
- ✅ PayPal button appears correctly for class events
- ✅ PayPal SDK loads without errors
- ✅ Payment summary displays properly
- ✅ Environment configuration works
- ✅ Error states display user-friendly messages
- ✅ Loading states provide visual feedback

### Integration Points Verified ✅
- ✅ Backend API integration (POST /api/events/{eventId}/tickets)
- ✅ React Query cache invalidation
- ✅ Toast notifications system
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Existing RSVP functionality unaffected

## Backend Integration Status

### Existing Infrastructure ✅
**Per handoff documents**:
- ✅ PayPal webhook system fully operational with Cloudflare tunnel
- ✅ Ticket purchase API endpoint fully functional
- ✅ Authentication and authorization working correctly
- ✅ Database schema supports ticket purchases

### Payment Processing ✅
- ✅ PayPal sandbox configuration active
- ✅ Webhook endpoint: `https://dev-api.chadfbennett.com/api/webhooks/paypal`
- ✅ Payment confirmation through existing webhook system
- ✅ Ticket creation after successful payment

## Known Limitations (Future Phases)

### Current Scope Limitations
- **Sliding Scale UI**: Currently uses default percentage (future: user-selectable slider)
- **Venmo Integration**: Placeholder only - not yet implemented
- **Refund Processing**: Manual process - automated refunds pending
- **Email Confirmations**: Basic notifications - rich email templates pending

### Future Enhancement Areas
1. **Enhanced Sliding Scale UI**: Interactive slider for custom pricing
2. **Venmo Integration**: Secondary payment option
3. **Refund Management**: Automated refund processing
4. **Enhanced Notifications**: Rich email templates with event details
5. **Payment History**: User dashboard for payment tracking
6. **Admin Payment Tools**: Refund management interface

## Error Handling

### PayPal Errors ✅
- ✅ Network failures: Graceful error messages
- ✅ Payment cancellation: Returns to ticket purchase option
- ✅ Invalid configuration: Clear setup error messages
- ✅ API failures: User-friendly retry options

### Backend Integration Errors ✅
- ✅ Ticket creation failures: Error notifications with retry option
- ✅ Authentication errors: Proper error handling
- ✅ Validation errors: Clear user guidance

## Security Considerations

### PayPal Security ✅
- ✅ Client-side integration only (no sensitive data exposed)
- ✅ PayPal handles all payment processing securely
- ✅ Webhook validation through existing backend system
- ✅ No payment information stored in frontend

### API Security ✅
- ✅ All API calls require authentication
- ✅ Payment confirmation through secure webhook system
- ✅ User isolation maintained
- ✅ HTTPS encryption throughout

## Performance Considerations

### PayPal SDK Loading ✅
- ✅ Lazy loading: PayPal SDK only loads when payment form shown
- ✅ Proper error boundaries prevent app crashes
- ✅ Loading states provide user feedback
- ✅ Payment form cancellation returns to normal state

### React Query Optimization ✅
- ✅ Smart cache invalidation on payment success
- ✅ Optimistic updates where appropriate
- ✅ Proper loading states throughout
- ✅ Error recovery mechanisms
