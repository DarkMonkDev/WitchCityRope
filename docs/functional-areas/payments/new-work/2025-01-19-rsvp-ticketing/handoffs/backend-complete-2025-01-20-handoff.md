# Backend Developer Handoff: RSVP Backend Implementation Complete
<!-- Date: 2025-01-20 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- From: Backend Developer Agent -->
<!-- To: React Developer / Test-Executor Agent -->
<!-- Status: Complete -->

## Executive Summary

RSVP backend implementation is **COMPLETE** with full functionality for both social event RSVPs and class ticket purchases. All API endpoints are fully functional and no longer returning mock data. The implementation includes proper authorization checks, validation, error handling, and audit trails.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Enhanced API Endpoints
**Status**: âœ… Complete and Fully Functional

**Updated Endpoints**:

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Authorization |
|--------|----------|---------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/events/{eventId}/participation` | Check user's participation status | Required |
| POST | `/api/events/{eventId}/rsvp` | Create RSVP (social events, vetted only) | Required |
| POST | `/api/events/{eventId}/tickets` | Purchase ticket (class events, any user) | Required |
| DELETE | `/api/events/{eventId}/participation` | Cancel participation (generic) | Required |
| DELETE | `/api/events/{eventId}/rsvp` | Cancel RSVP (backward compatibility) | Required |
| GET | `/api/user/participations` | Get user's all participations | Required |

### 2. New Business Logic Implementation

**Ticket Purchase Functionality** âœ… **NEW**:
- âœ… Any authenticated user can purchase tickets for class events
- âœ… Proper event type validation (Class events only)
- âœ… Capacity management with full validation
- âœ… Comprehensive audit trail creation
- âœ… Payment method tracking (prepared for future payment integration)

**Enhanced Authorization** âœ… **IMPROVED**:
- âœ… RSVP creation: Only vetted members for social events
- âœ… Ticket purchase: Any authenticated user for class events
- âœ… User isolation: Users can only see/modify their own participations
- âœ… Proper event type validation for each operation

**Backward Compatibility** âœ… **MAINTAINED**:
- âœ… Original `/api/events/{eventId}/rsvp` DELETE endpoint maintained
- âœ… New generic `/api/events/{eventId}/participation` DELETE endpoint added
- âœ… Existing frontend calls will continue to work without changes

### 3. New Models Added

**Files Created**:
- `/apps/api/Features/Participation/Models/CreateTicketPurchaseRequest.cs` - Ticket purchase request model

**Enhanced Service Interface**:
- Added `CreateTicketPurchaseAsync` method to `IParticipationService`
- Maintained existing interface methods for compatibility

### 4. Implementation Patterns Applied

**ðŸš¨ Critical Entity Framework Patterns** âœ… **CORRECTLY APPLIED**:
```csharp
// âœ… CORRECT - All entity models use simple properties without initializers
public class EventParticipation
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }  // Simple property, EF handles generation
}
```

**ðŸš¨ UTC DateTime Handling** âœ… **CORRECTLY APPLIED**:
- All DateTime operations use UTC for PostgreSQL compatibility
- Proper timestamptz column type configuration maintained

**ðŸš¨ Result Pattern Implementation** âœ… **CORRECTLY APPLIED**:
```csharp
// âœ… CORRECT - Consistent error handling throughout
public async Task<Result<ParticipationStatusDto>> CreateTicketPurchaseAsync(...)
{
    try
    {
        // Business logic
        return Result<ParticipationStatusDto>.Success(dto);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        return Result<ParticipationStatusDto>.Failure("Error message", ex.Message);
    }
}
```

## Business Logic Validation

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Database Migration
âœ… **NO CHANGES REQUIRED** - Uses existing database schema from previous handoff

### 2. Test Accounts
Use existing test accounts:
- **Vetted Member**: `vetted@witchcityrope.com` / `Test123!`
- **General Member**: `member@witchcityrope.com` / `Test123!`

### 3. Test Scenarios

**RSVP Testing** (Vetted Members Only):
1. Login as vetted member
2. Create social event (if needed)
3. POST `/api/events/{eventId}/rsvp` with valid request
4. Verify 201 Created response with participation details
5. Test capacity limits and duplicate prevention

**Ticket Purchase Testing** (Any User):
1. Login as any authenticated user
2. Create class event (if needed)
3. POST `/api/events/{eventId}/tickets` with valid request
4. Verify 201 Created response with participation details
5. Test capacity limits and duplicate prevention

**Authorization Testing**:
1. Login as general (non-vetted) member
2. Attempt RSVP for social event - should get 400 "Only vetted members"
3. Attempt ticket purchase for class event - should succeed
4. Attempt RSVP for class event - should get 400 "RSVPs only for social events"
5. Attempt ticket purchase for social event - should get 400 "Tickets only for class events"

### 4. Validation Testing

**Business Rule Validation**:
- âœ… Vetted member requirement for RSVPs
- âœ… Event type validation (Social vs Class)
- âœ… Capacity management
- âœ… Duplicate participation prevention
- âœ… User isolation (can't access other's data)

**Error Response Testing**:
- âœ… All error conditions return appropriate HTTP status codes
- âœ… Error messages are descriptive and actionable
- âœ… Server errors are properly logged

## Security Implementation

### Data Protection
âœ… **ENHANCED**:
- User isolation - users can only access their own data
- Event access validation for all operations
- Comprehensive audit trail for all changes
- IP address and user agent tracking in audit logs

### Authorization Enforcement
âœ… **COMPREHENSIVE**:
- All endpoints require authentication
- User ID extracted from JWT claims (not request body)
- Business rule enforcement (vetted vs general members)
- Event type validation for appropriate participation types

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization
âœ… **MAINTAINED**:
- Strategic indexes for event/user queries (from previous migration)
- GIN indexes for JSONB metadata
- Partial indexes for active participations
- Unique constraints for business rules

### Query Patterns
âœ… **OPTIMIZED**:
- AsNoTracking() for read-only queries
- Projections for list queries
- Efficient joins for participation data
- Proper cancellation token support throughout

## Frontend Integration Ready

### NSwag Type Generation
âœ… **PREPARED**:
- All DTOs properly structured for auto-generation
- New `CreateTicketPurchaseRequest` model included
- API endpoints properly documented with OpenAPI attributes
- Enum types included for frontend TypeScript generation

### API Usage Examples

**Check Participation Status**:
```javascript
GET /api/events/{eventId}/participation
// Returns: ParticipationStatusDto | null
```

**Create RSVP (Vetted Members Only)**:
```javascript
POST /api/events/{eventId}/rsvp
{
  "eventId": "guid",
  "notes": "string (optional)"
}
// Returns: ParticipationStatusDto
```

**Purchase Ticket (Any User)**:
```javascript
POST /api/events/{eventId}/tickets
{
  "eventId": "guid",
  "notes": "string (optional)",
  "paymentMethodId": "string (optional)"
}
// Returns: ParticipationStatusDto
```

**Cancel Participation**:
```javascript
DELETE /api/events/{eventId}/participation?reason=string
// Returns: 204 No Content
```

**Get User Participations**:
```javascript
GET /api/user/participations
// Returns: UserParticipationDto[]
```

## Next Phase Requirements

### For React Developer
1. **Update Event Detail Pages**: Add both RSVP and ticket purchase buttons based on event type
2. **User Dashboard Enhancement**: Display both RSVPs and ticket purchases
3. **Authorization UI**: Show appropriate actions based on user vetted status
4. **Status Indicators**: Display participation status and capacity information

### For Test-Executor
1. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete RSVP and ticket purchase flows
2. **Authorization Testing**: Verify business rule enforcement
3. **Capacity Testing**: Test event capacity limits
4. **Error Handling**: Verify all error scenarios work correctly

## Known Limitations (Future Phases)

### Current Scope Limitations
- **Payment Processing**: Ticket purchasing doesn't process actual payments (PayPal integration pending)
- **Email Notifications**: Participation confirmations not implemented
- **Waitlist Management**: Waitlist functionality needs enhancement
