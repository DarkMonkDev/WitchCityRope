## Architecture Alignment Verification

### Mandatory Architecture Discovery Completed
âœ… **domain-layer-architecture.md**: Lines 725-997 - NSwag auto-generation pipeline confirmed
âœ… **DTO-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md**: Lines 85-213 - API DTOs as source of truth implemented
âœ… **functional-area-master-index.md**: Lines 24, 35-61 - PayPal webhook integration leveraged
âœ… **events/business-requirements.md**: Session-based event foundation integrated

### Architecture Compliance
- **NSwag Type Generation**: All DTOs designed for auto-generation (NO manual TypeScript interfaces)
- **PayPal Integration**: Builds on operational webhook infrastructure
- **BFF Authentication**: Uses established httpOnly cookie pattern
- **Database Patterns**: Follows Entity Framework Core conventions
- **API Design**: Minimal API feature-based organization

## Critical Implementation Notes

### ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: NSwag Type Generation
**NEVER CREATE MANUAL TYPESCRIPT INTERFACES**
- All DTOs in specification are C# source of truth
- Frontend MUST use `@witchcityrope/shared-types` generated interfaces
- Run `npm run generate:types` when API changes
- Reference: domain-layer-architecture.md lines 725-997

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: PayPal Webhook Integration
**LEVERAGE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE**
- PayPal webhook processing is operational (functional-area-master-index.md lines 35-61)
- Build on existing webhook handler patterns
- Do NOT recreate payment processing infrastructure
- Extend existing `PayPalWebhookEvent` handling

### ðŸš¨ SECURITY: BFF Authentication Pattern
**FOLLOW ESTABLISHED PATTERNS**
- Use httpOnly cookies for all API calls
- Role-based authorization already implemented
- CSRF protection required for state changes
- NO localStorage for authentication tokens

## Technical Dependencies

### Prerequisites for Implementation
1. **Database Migrations**: EventParticipations and TicketPurchases tables
2. **NSwag Pipeline**: Ensure type generation is operational
3. **PayPal Configuration**: Webhook endpoints configured
4. **Role Validation**: Vetted member checks for RSVP functionality

### External Integrations
- **PayPal API**: Order creation and webhook processing
- **SendGrid**: Email notifications (sandbox mode for development)
- **PostgreSQL**: Data persistence with Entity Framework Core

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core RSVP Functionality
**Target: Week 1-2**
- RSVP creation/cancellation for social events
- Participation status checking
- Basic admin participant lists

### Phase 2: Ticket Purchase Integration
**Target: Week 3-4**
- PayPal order creation
- Webhook handling for payment completion
- Ticket confirmation emails

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
**Target: Week 5-6**
- Real-time capacity monitoring
- Enhanced admin management
- Performance optimizations

## Developer Handoff Information

### For React Developer
**Primary Focus**: Frontend implementation with React Query and Zustand
**Key Files**:
- Generated types from `@witchcityrope/shared-types`
- React Query hooks for API integration
- State management for participation status

**Critical Requirements**:
- Use generated TypeScript interfaces ONLY
- Implement error boundaries for participation components
- Real-time capacity updates via polling
- Mantine v7 UI components for consistency

### For Backend Developer
**Primary Focus**: API endpoints and business logic services
**Key Files**:
- Feature-based organization in `/apps/api/Features/Participation/`
- Entity Framework Core models and migrations
- PayPal webhook integration extensions

**Critical Requirements**:
- Follow vertical slice architecture patterns
- Implement comprehensive business rule validation
- Extend existing PayPal webhook handlers
- Maintain sub-200ms response time targets

### For Test Developer
**Primary Focus**: Comprehensive test coverage across all layers
**Key Files**:
- Unit tests for business logic (100% coverage)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for complete participation flows

**Critical Requirements**:
- Mock PayPal integration for testing
- Test capacity enforcement scenarios
- Validate error handling paths
- Performance testing for admin participant lists

## Quality Gates

### Before Development Begins
- [ ] Architecture Discovery validated by all developers
- [ ] NSwag type generation pipeline operational
- [ ] PayPal sandbox environment configured
- [ ] Database migration scripts reviewed

### Before Code Review
- [ ] All DTOs properly annotated for NSwag generation
- [ ] No manual TypeScript interfaces created
- [ ] Business rules implemented with comprehensive validation
- [ ] Error handling follows established patterns

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Integration tests passing with PayPal sandbox
- [ ] Performance targets met for all endpoints
- [ ] Security review completed for payment flows
- [ ] Database migrations tested in staging environment

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- **API Response Times**: All endpoints under specified targets (200-1000ms)
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with generated types
- **Test Coverage**: 95%+ unit test coverage, 100% E2E coverage
- **Error Rates**: < 1% for participation operations

### Business Metrics
- **RSVP Success Rate**: > 99%
- **Payment Success Rate**: > 95% (leveraging existing PayPal infrastructure)
- **User Experience**: Seamless integration with existing event management

## Questions for Development Teams

### Clarification Needed
1. **Email Templates**: Should we extend existing email service or create participation-specific templates?
2. **Capacity Monitoring**: Real-time vs polling frequency preferences?
3. **Admin Dashboard**: Integration with existing admin UI components?
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Specific mobile UI considerations?

### Risk Mitigation
1. **PayPal Integration**: Fallback strategy if webhook delivery fails?
2. **Database Performance**: Indexing strategy for large event participant lists?
3. **Concurrent Purchases**: Handling simultaneous ticket purchases near capacity?
