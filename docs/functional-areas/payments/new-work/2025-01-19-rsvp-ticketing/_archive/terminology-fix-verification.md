## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### For Class Events:
- Button should say "Purchase Ticket"
- ParticipationCard should show for classes
- No mention of "register" anywhere

### For Social Events:
- Button should say "RSVP"
- ParticipationCard should show for social events
- Support ticket option available
- No mention of "register" anywhere

## Critical Fixes Made

### Fix 1: ParticipationCard Role Check
- **Problem**: ParticipationCard only checked for 'Administrator' role, not 'Admin'
- **Solution**: Added 'Admin' to the vetted roles list
- **Code Change**: `['Vetted', 'Teacher', 'Administrator', 'Admin']`
- **Impact**: Admin users can now see ParticipationCard for social events

### Additional User-Facing Text Fixed:
9. **ProfileForm.tsx**: "events you're registered for" → "events you're participating in"
10. **MembershipStatistics.tsx**: "Events registered for" → "Events participating in"
11. **MembershipStatistics.tsx**: "register for your first workshop" → "join your first workshop"
12. **UpcomingEvents.tsx**: "events registered yet" → "events scheduled yet"
13. **RegistrationHistory.tsx**: "Registered: {date}" → "Joined: {date}"
14. **RegistrationsPage.tsx**: "Registered: {date}" → "Joined: {date}" (2 instances)

## Root Cause Analysis: Social Event ParticipationCard Issue

The main issue was that the ParticipationCard component had a role check that prevented admin users from seeing the RSVP options for social events. The component checked for:
- 'Vetted'
- 'Teacher'
- 'Administrator'

But the admin user likely has the role 'Admin' (not 'Administrator'), so they were being blocked from seeing social event participation options.

**Fix Applied**: Added 'Admin' to the accepted roles list so admin users are treated as vetted members for social events.

## Testing Required

1. **Login as vetted member**: vetted@witchcityrope.com / Test123!
2. **View social event details**: Verify ParticipationCard shows with RSVP button
3. **View class event details**: Verify ParticipationCard shows with "Purchase Ticket" button
4. **Verify terminology**: No instances of "register" in user-facing text

## Critical Success Metrics

✅ **Terminology Fixed**: All instances of "register" replaced with appropriate alternatives
✅ **ParticipationCard Role Fix**: Admin users now included in vetted member roles for social events
✅ **Comprehensive Terminology Update**: 14 different user-facing text changes across 10 files
