# Business Requirements: Docker Implementation of Proven Authentication System
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-17 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Business Requirements Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary
Containerize the EXISTING WORKING authentication system (React + .NET API + PostgreSQL) to validate it operates identically in Docker environment. This is NOT rebuilding authentication - it's packaging and validating our proven Hybrid JWT + HttpOnly Cookie authentication system that currently works perfectly at localhost:5173 (React) and localhost:5655 (API).

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
The WitchCityRope authentication system is fully functional in the development environment but needs to be containerized to:
- Enable consistent development environments across team members
- Prepare for deployment scenarios
- Validate the authentication architecture works in containerized environments
- Maintain development efficiency with Docker workflows

### Business Value
- **Risk Mitigation**: Validate authentication works in containers before deployment
- **Team Efficiency**: Consistent development environments eliminate "works on my machine" issues
- **Deployment Readiness**: Containerized services enable flexible deployment options
- **Development Velocity**: Docker-based workflows can speed up onboarding and testing
- **Zero Cost**: Maintains our no-commercial-auth-service approach

### Success Metrics
- **Functionality**: 100% authentication feature parity between native and containerized environments
- **Performance**: <2s initial load time, <50ms API response times maintained in containers
- **Development Experience**: Hot reload functionality preserved for both React and .NET API
- **Reliability**: Zero authentication failures during container restarts or network issues

## User Stories

### Story 1: Authentication Feature Parity
**As a** WitchCityRope user
**I want to** use all authentication features (register, login, protected access, logout) 
**So that** the containerized system provides identical functionality to the working development system

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the system is running in Docker containers
- When I access http://localhost:5173 (React app)
- Then I can register a new account with testuser@example.com / Test1234
- And I can log in successfully with the same credentials
- And I can access protected pages that require authentication
- And I can log out and lose access to protected content
- And all authentication flows work identically to the non-containerized version

### Story 2: Developer Workflow Preservation
**As a** developer working on WitchCityRope
**I want to** maintain hot reload and efficient development workflows
**So that** containerization doesn't slow down my development process

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the Docker development environment is running
- When I modify React component source code
- Then the changes appear immediately via Vite hot reload
- And when I modify .NET API code
- Then the API restarts quickly with dotnet watch
- And the development experience is equivalent to running services natively

### Story 3: Service Communication Validation
**As a** system administrator
**I want to** verify service-to-service communication works correctly in containers
**So that** the authentication system's JWT and cookie handling functions properly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given React, API, and PostgreSQL are running in separate containers
- When React makes authenticated API calls
- Then JWT tokens are properly validated between containers
- And HttpOnly cookies work correctly across the container network
- And all service-to-service authentication flows function as designed

### Story 4: Test Infrastructure Integration
**As a** quality assurance engineer
**I want to** run E2E tests against the containerized system
**So that** I can validate authentication functionality in a container environment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given the Docker environment is running
- When I execute Playwright E2E tests
- Then all authentication tests pass
- And test infrastructure at localhost:8080 is accessible
- And test results match those from the native environment

### Story 5: Comprehensive Docker Operations Documentation
**As a** development team member (test-executor, backend-developer, react-developer)
**I want to** access comprehensive Docker operations guidance
**So that** I can efficiently manage containers during development and troubleshooting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I need to work with Docker containers
- When I need to start, stop, restart, or troubleshoot containers
- Then I have access to comprehensive operations guide covering all common scenarios
- And the guide is accessible from central documentation structure
- And the guide includes hot reload testing procedures for .NET API
- And troubleshooting steps address common development issues

### Story 6: Agent-Accessible Docker Architecture
**As an** AI development agent (orchestrator, backend-developer, test-executor)
**I want to** be directed to appropriate Docker documentation
**So that** I can efficiently perform Docker-related tasks without searching

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Given I need to perform Docker operations
- When orchestrator assigns me Docker-related tasks
- Then I receive direct links to relevant Docker documentation
- And I know where to find Docker architecture overview
- And I can access Docker operations guide specific to my role
- And documentation structure supports automated agent workflows

## Business Rules

1. **Zero Code Changes**: No modifications to existing authentication code are permitted - only configuration and containerization
2. **Port Preservation**: Maintain existing port mappings where possible (5173 for React, 5655 for API, 5433 for PostgreSQL)
3. **Test User Compatibility**: The existing test user (testuser@example.com / Test1234) must work identically
4. **Security Maintenance**: All security patterns (XSS protection, CSRF protection, secure cookie handling) must be preserved
5. **Performance Baseline**: Container performance must meet or exceed native development performance
6. **Hot Reload Requirement**: Both React (Vite) and .NET (dotnet watch) hot reload must function properly
7. **Data Persistence**: Database data must survive container restarts
8. **Network Isolation**: Services must communicate via Docker network, not localhost

## Constraints & Assumptions
