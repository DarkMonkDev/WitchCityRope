## KEY REQUIREMENTS HIGHLIGHTS

### Core Business Goals
1. **Containerize Existing Authentication**: NO rebuilding - only packaging current working system
2. **Preserve Functionality**: 100% authentication feature parity between native and containerized environments
3. **Maintain Development Experience**: Hot reload for both React (Vite) and .NET API (dotnet watch)
4. **Validate Service Communication**: JWT + HttpOnly cookies across container network
5. **Comprehensive Docker Operations Guide**: Create comprehensive guide covering container management, troubleshooting, and hot reload testing
6. **Central Docker Architecture Documentation**: Establish centralized documentation at `/docs/architecture/docker-architecture.md`
7. **Agent Accessibility**: Ensure all agents have Docker knowledge through lessons learned files
8. **Hot Reload Testing**: Implement systematic hot reload validation procedures for .NET API

### Critical Functional Requirements
- **Container Architecture**: 4-service Docker Compose setup (React, API, PostgreSQL, Test Infrastructure)
- **Port Preservation**: localhost:5173 (React), localhost:5655 (API), localhost:5433 (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication Flows**: Register, login, protected access, logout working identically
- **Performance**: <2s React load, <50ms API response, <100ms database operations
- **Hot Reload**: React changes <1s, API restart <5s

### Technical Constraints
- **Zero Authentication Code Changes**: Only configuration and containerization
- **Service Network**: Container-to-container communication via Docker bridge network
- **Data Persistence**: Database survives container restarts
- **Environment Variables**: Container-aware configuration management

### Success Criteria
1. **Functional Validation**: All authentication endpoints work in containers
2. **Performance Validation**: Meets native development benchmarks
3. **Developer Experience**: Equivalent workflow efficiency
4. **Testing Integration**: E2E tests pass against containerized services

```

### Service Communication Strategy
- **Internal Network**: Custom bridge network `witchcityrope-dev`
- **DNS Resolution**: Service names (web, api, postgres) resolve to container IPs
- **Authentication Flow**: React → api:8080/api/auth/* → postgres:5432
- **CORS Configuration**: Container and host origins properly configured

### Development Workflow Preservation
- **React Hot Reload**: Vite dev server with file watching via volume mounts
- **API Hot Reload**: dotnet watch with source code volume mounting
- **Database Persistence**: PostgreSQL data survives container lifecycle
- **Startup Script**: `./dev.sh` for complete environment initialization

### Security Considerations
- **JWT Handling**: Service-to-service validation preserved in container network
- **HttpOnly Cookies**: Cross-container cookie management maintained
- **Environment Secrets**: Development-appropriate secret management
- **Network Isolation**: Services communicate via Docker network, not localhost

## RISK ASSESSMENT

### Identified Risks
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Service-to-service auth networking | Medium | High | Use Docker bridge network with service names, test JWT validation |
| Hot reload file watching | Low | Medium | Use volume mounting with polling for cross-platform compatibility |
