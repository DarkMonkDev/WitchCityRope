## Design Highlights

### Overall Docker Architecture

**4-Container System:**
- **React Container**: Vite development server with HMR support (Port 5173)
- **API Container**: .NET Minimal API with hot reload (Port 5655)  
- **Database Container**: PostgreSQL 16 Alpine with persistence (Port 5433)
- **Test Container**: Isolated testing environment (Port 8080)

**Networking**: Custom bridge network `witchcity-net` (172.20.0.0/16) for secure inter-container communication

**Persistence**: Dedicated volumes for database data, Node.js modules, and NuGet package caching

### Environment Strategy

**Three-Layer Configuration Approach:**

1. **Base Layer** (`docker-compose.yml`): Shared configuration, networking, and base service definitions
2. **Environment Overlays**: 
   - `docker-compose.dev.yml`: Hot reload, debugging tools, relaxed security
   - `docker-compose.test.yml`: Isolated, ephemeral, CI/CD optimized
   - `docker-compose.prod.yml`: Hardened security, resource limits, secrets management

**Command Pattern**:
- Development: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up`
- Testing: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.test.yml up`
- Production: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml up`

### Multi-Stage Build Approach

**React Container**:
- Development: Vite dev server with volume mounts for hot reload
- Production: Nginx-served static build with optimized assets

**.NET API Container**:
- Development: SDK container with watch mode and debugging
- Production: Runtime-only container with published application

**Benefits**: Smaller production images, preserved development experience, optimized build caching

### Hot Reload Preservation

**React Hot Module Replacement**:
- Volume mount: `./apps/web:/app` for source code changes
- Node modules cache: Separate volume for dependency isolation
- WebSocket support: Exposed Vite HMR port with proper networking

**.NET API Hot Reload**:
- Volume mount: `./apps/api:/app` for source code changes
- NuGet cache: Separate volume for package management
- Watch mode: `dotnet watch` integration for automatic rebuilds

## Key Design Decisions

### PostgreSQL Database Strategy
- **Image**: `postgres:16-alpine` for security and minimal footprint
- **Persistence**: Named volume `postgres_data` for data durability across container restarts
- **Configuration**: Environment-specific tuning (dev: relaxed, test: ephemeral, prod: hardened)
- **Health Checks**: Automated readiness probes for dependent services

### .NET API Container Strategy  
- **Multi-Stage Build**: SDK stage for building, runtime stage for execution
- **Authentication**: Preserved ASP.NET Core Identity with JWT service-to-service communication
- **Development**: Volume mounts with `dotnet watch` for hot reload
- **Production**: Minimal runtime image with published application

### React Container Strategy
- **Development**: Vite dev server with HMR support via volume mounts
- **Production**: Multi-stage build with Nginx serving optimized static assets
- **Networking**: Proper container communication for API calls
- **Caching**: Node modules isolation to prevent development/production conflicts

### Networking Design
- **Internal Network**: Custom bridge network for secure container communication
- **Port Mapping**: Consistent localhost ports (5173 React, 5655 API, 5433 PostgreSQL)
- **Service Discovery**: Container name-based DNS resolution
- **Security**: Network isolation with explicit service exposure

### Authentication Pattern Preservation
- **Hybrid JWT + HttpOnly Cookies**: Exact preservation of working pattern
- **Service-to-Service**: JWT tokens for React → API communication
- **Session Management**: HttpOnly cookies for secure session handling
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin setup for containerized services

## Environment Configurations

### Development Environment
**Focus**: Developer productivity, debugging, rapid iteration

**Key Features**:
- Hot reload for both React and .NET API
- Volume mounts for real-time source code changes
- Debugging tools and verbose logging
- Relaxed security for development convenience
- Separate Node.js and NuGet caches for performance

**Security Level**: Relaxed (development certificates, permissive CORS, detailed error messages)

### Test Environment  
**Focus**: Isolated testing, CI/CD optimization, ephemeral instances

**Key Features**:
- Ephemeral database (no persistence)
- Pre-built images for faster startup
- Isolated networks for test isolation
- Automated health checks for test readiness
- Playwright E2E test integration

**Security Level**: Moderate (test certificates, controlled access)

### Production Environment
**Focus**: Security hardening, performance optimization, resource management

**Key Features**:
- Hardened container security (non-root users, read-only filesystems)
- Resource limits and monitoring
- Secrets management for sensitive configuration
- Optimized static asset serving with Nginx
- Database connection pooling and tuning

**Security Level**: Hardened (production certificates, strict CORS, minimal error disclosure)
