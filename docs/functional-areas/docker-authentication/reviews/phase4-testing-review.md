## Issues Identified and Resolutions

### Issue 1: React Proxy Configuration (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Impact**: Development workflow convenience
- **Status**: Does not affect core functionality
- **Details**: React Vite proxy returns HTTP 500 for /api/* routes
- **Workaround**: Direct API calls to localhost:5655 work perfectly
- **Resolution**: React developer should verify proxy target matches API port
- **Timeline**: Can be addressed in regular development cycle

### Issue 2: React Hot Reload (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Impact**: Development speed convenience
- **Status**: Does not affect authentication functionality
- **Details**: React HMR not reflecting file changes in browser
- **Workaround**: API hot reload working perfectly
- **Resolution**: React developer should check Vite HMR configuration
- **Timeline**: Can be addressed in regular development cycle

### Issue 3: Web Container Health Check (MONITORING ONLY)
- **Impact**: Docker monitoring accuracy
- **Status**: False positive - container functions normally
- **Resolution**: DevOps should adjust health check configuration
