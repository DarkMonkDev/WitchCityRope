## Testing Readiness

### What's Ready to Test
1. **Container Startup**: All containers should start with `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`
2. **Service Communication**: React app should communicate with API through container networking
3. **Authentication Flows**: Login, register, and protected routes should work identically
4. **Hot Reload**: Code changes should trigger automatic reloads in development
5. **Database Operations**: All CRUD operations should work through containerized PostgreSQL

### How to Start Testing
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/docker-dev.sh

# Verify health
./scripts/docker-health.sh

# Check logs if issues
./scripts/docker-logs.sh
```
