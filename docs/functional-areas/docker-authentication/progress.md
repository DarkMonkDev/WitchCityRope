### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Container startup time < 30 seconds
- [ ] Auth flow response time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage reasonable for development
- [ ] Hot reload response time < 5 seconds

## Critical Constraints

1. **NO Authentication Changes**: The auth system is working perfectly - only containerize it
2. **Preserve Current URLs**: localhost:5173 (React), localhost:5655 (API)
3. **Service-to-Service Auth**: JWT token flow between React and API must work in containers
4. **Development Experience**: Hot reload must work for both React (Vite) and .NET API
5. **Test Compatibility**: Playwright E2E tests must work with containerized environment

## Risk Factors

### High Risk
- Service-to-service authentication networking in containers
- Hot reload volume mounting and file watching
- Database connection string changes

### Medium Risk
- Port conflicts between host and containers
- Certificate handling for HTTPS
- Environment variable management

### Low Risk
- Basic container creation
- Docker compose setup
- Volume configuration

## Dependencies

- Working authentication system (COMPLETE)
- Docker knowledge from old Blazor implementation (EXTRACTED)
- Current React + .NET + PostgreSQL stack understanding
