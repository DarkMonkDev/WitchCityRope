## Implementation Patterns Established

### 1. NSwag Type Generation Pattern ✅

#### Build Integration
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate-types": "nswag run nswag.json",
    "build": "npm run generate-types && vite build",
    "dev": "npm run generate-types && vite dev"
  }
}
```

#### Generated Type Usage
```typescript
// All types auto-generated from OpenAPI spec
import { LoginRequest, LoginResponse, User, UserRole } from '@witchcityrope/shared-types';

// Type-safe API calls with generated types
const useLogin = () => useMutation<LoginResponse, Error, LoginRequest>({
  mutationFn: async (credentials: LoginRequest) => {
    const response = await apiClient.post('/api/auth/login', credentials);
    return response.data; // Fully typed with LoginResponse
  }
});
```

### 2. TanStack Query Authentication Mutations ✅

#### Login Mutation Pattern
```typescript
export const useLogin = () => {
  const setUser = useAuthStore(state => state.setUser);
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (credentials: LoginRequest) => {
      const response = await apiClient.post('/api/auth/login', credentials);
      return response.data.data || response.data; // Handle nested responses
    },
    onSuccess: (user: User) => {
      setUser(user);
      navigate('/dashboard');
    },
    onError: (error: Error) => {
      // Type-safe error handling with generated error types
    }
  });
};
```

#### Logout Mutation Pattern
```typescript
export const useLogout = () => {
  const clearUser = useAuthStore(state => state.logout);
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async () => {
      await apiClient.post('/api/auth/logout');
    },
    onSuccess: () => {
      clearUser();
      navigate('/login');
    }
  });
};
```

### 3. Zustand Authentication Store ✅

#### State Management Pattern
```typescript
interface AuthState {
  user: User | null;
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  setUser: (user: User | null) => void;
  logout: () => void;
  checkAuth: () => Promise<void>;
}

export const useAuthStore = create<AuthState>((set, get) => ({
  user: null,
  isAuthenticated: false,
  setUser: (user) => set({ user, isAuthenticated: !!user }),
  logout: () => set({ user: null, isAuthenticated: false }),
  checkAuth: async () => {
    try {
      const response = await apiClient.get('/api/auth/user');
      const user = response.data.data || response.data;
      set({ user, isAuthenticated: !!user });
    } catch (error) {
      set({ user: null, isAuthenticated: false });
    }
  }
}));
```

### 4. React Router v7 Protected Routes ✅

#### Authentication Loader Pattern
```typescript
export const authLoader = async (): Promise<User | Response> => {
  const { checkAuth, isAuthenticated, user } = useAuthStore.getState();
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    await checkAuth();
  }
  
  if (!useAuthStore.getState().isAuthenticated) {
    return redirect('/login');
  }
  
  return useAuthStore.getState().user!;
};
```

#### Protected Route Configuration
```typescript
const router = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: '/login',
    element: <LoginPage />
  },
  {
    path: '/dashboard',
    element: <DashboardPage />,
    loader: authLoader // Automatic authentication check
  },
  {
    path: '/admin',
    element: <AdminPage />,
    loader: adminAuthLoader // Role-based protection
  }
]);
```

### 5. Mantine Form Integration ✅

#### Type-Safe Form Pattern
```typescript
const LoginForm = () => {
  const login = useLogin();
  
  const form = useForm<LoginRequest>({
    initialValues: {
      email: '',
      password: ''
    },
    validate: zodResolver(loginValidationSchema)
  });

  const handleSubmit = (values: LoginRequest) => {
    login.mutate(values); // Fully type-safe with generated types
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={form.onSubmit(handleSubmit)}>
      <TextInput
        {...form.getInputProps('email')}
        label="Email"
        required
      />
      <PasswordInput
        {...form.getInputProps('password')}
        label="Password"
        required
      />
      <Button type="submit" loading={login.isPending}>
        Sign In
      </Button>
    </form>
  );
};
```

import { useAuthStore } from '@/stores/authStore';
import { User, LoginRequest, LoginResponse } from '@witchcityrope/shared-types';

// Copy-paste ready authentication implementation
const MyNewFeature = () => {
  const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuthStore();
  const login = useLogin();
  
  // All types auto-generated, all patterns working
};
```

#### Recommended Next Actions
```bash
# Option 1: Extend authentication with role-based features
/orchestrate "Implement role-based access control using the completed React authentication system. Add admin, teacher, and member-specific routes and features using the established TanStack Query + Zustand + generated types patterns."

# Option 2: Implement user management features  
/orchestrate "Create user management interface using the proven authentication patterns. Include user profile editing, account settings, and administrative user management using Mantine v7 components and generated types."

# Option 3: Add event management with authentication
/orchestrate "Implement event management features using the complete authentication system. Include event creation, registration, and management with proper role-based access using established React patterns."
```
