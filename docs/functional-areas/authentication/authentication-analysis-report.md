# Authentication Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The authentication system is not persisting login state after form submission. Testing reveals that while the login page loads correctly and accepts credentials, no actual authentication API calls are being made when the Sign In button is clicked.

## Key Findings

### 1. Page Navigation Flow
- Initial request to `/login` redirects to `/identity/account/login`
- The redirect happens automatically via Blazor routing
- Both URLs return HTTP 200 status codes

### 2. Missing Authentication API Calls
- **Critical Issue**: No POST requests to authentication endpoints when Sign In is clicked
- Expected calls to `/api/identity/account/login` or `/Auth/Login` are not happening
- The form submission appears to be a no-op (no operation)

### 3. Client-Side State
- **localStorage**: Remains empty before and after login attempt
- **sessionStorage**: Remains empty before and after login attempt
- **Cookies**: Only contains `.AspNetCore.Antiforgery` cookie (CSRF protection)
- **JWT Token**: Not found in any storage mechanism

### 4. Blazor/SignalR Connection
- Blazor WebSocket connection established successfully
- SignalR hub connected at `ws://localhost:5651/_blazor`
- NavigationManager is initialized
- No Blazor-specific errors detected

### 5. Form Analysis
- Multiple forms detected on the login page (2 forms found)
- Login form contains proper email and password inputs
- Sign In button is present and clickable
- Form appears to have proper structure but lacks submission handler

## Network Traffic Analysis

### Successful Requests:
- `GET /login` → 200 OK
- `GET /identity/account/login` → 200 OK
- `POST /_blazor/negotiate` → 200 OK (SignalR negotiation)
- WebSocket connection established

### Missing Requests:
- No `POST /api/identity/account/login`
- No `POST /Auth/Login`
- No authentication-related API calls whatsoever

### 404 Errors (Non-critical):
- `/_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Core/styles/bootstrap5.css`
- `/favicon.ico`

## Root Cause Analysis

The authentication form is not wired to submit data to the backend API. Possible causes:

1. **Missing Event Handler**: The Sign In button click event is not bound to an authentication method
2. **Form Submission Prevention**: JavaScript/Blazor may be preventing default form submission without providing alternative handling
3. **Incorrect Form Configuration**: The form may be missing proper action/method attributes or Blazor event handlers

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Verify Login Component Code**:
   - Check if `@onclick` handler is properly bound to Sign In button
   - Ensure the authentication method is actually calling the API service
   - Verify form has `@onsubmit` or button has proper click handler

2. **Check AuthService Implementation**:
   - Confirm `AuthService.LoginAsync()` method exists and is properly implemented
   - Verify it makes HTTP POST request to correct endpoint
   - Check if service is properly injected into the login component

3. **Review API Endpoint Configuration**:
   - Verify `/api/identity/account/login` endpoint exists and is accessible
   - Check CORS configuration if API is on different port
   - Ensure API base URL is correctly configured in `appsettings.json`

4. **Browser Developer Tools Investigation**:
   - Set breakpoints in browser DevTools on button click
   - Monitor Network tab while clicking Sign In
   - Check Console for any JavaScript errors during submission

### Code Areas to Investigate:

1. `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Features/Auth/Login.razor`
2. `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Services/AuthService.cs`
3. `/src/WitchCityRope.Api/Features/Auth/AuthController.cs`
4. `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/appsettings.json` (API configuration)

## Testing Scripts Created

The following Puppeteer test scripts were created for debugging:

1. **test-login-enhanced.js**: Comprehensive logging with console capture, network monitoring, and localStorage checking
2. **test-login-har.js**: HTTP Archive (HAR) capture for detailed network analysis
3. **test-login-simple.js**: Simplified test focusing on authentication flow
4. **test-auth-flow.js**: Form analysis and submission tracking

All test results confirm the same issue: form submission does not trigger any authentication API calls.

## Next Steps

1. Review the Blazor login component code to ensure proper event handling
2. Verify the AuthService is making actual HTTP requests
3. Check browser console for any client-side errors during form submission
4. Test the authentication API endpoint directly with curl/Postman to ensure it's working
5. Add logging to the login component to trace the execution flow

The core issue appears to be a disconnection between the UI form and the backend authentication service. The form exists and can be filled out, but clicking Sign In does not trigger the expected authentication flow.
