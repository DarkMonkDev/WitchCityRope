<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-12 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Technology Researcher Agent -->
<!-- Status: Draft -->

## Executive Summary
**Decision Required**: Optimal authentication strategy for React 18.3.1 + ASP.NET Core 9.0 architecture addressing token refresh without user disruption
**Recommendation**: BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) Pattern with HttpOnly Cookies (High confidence: 90%)
**Key Factors**: Security (eliminates browser token storage), UX (silent refresh), Industry Standard (OWASP 2025 recommended)

## Research Scope
### Requirements
- Resolve "logout after waiting" issue with token expiry
- Secure authentication for React 18.3.1 + TypeScript 5.6.3 + ASP.NET Core 9.0
- Support existing technology stack (Zustand, Axios, TanStack Query)
- Compatible with WitchCityRope's safety/privacy requirements
- Mobile-first user experience
- Production-ready security against XSS/CSRF attacks

### Success Criteria
- Silent token refresh without user interruption
- No authentication tokens stored in browser JavaScript
- Sub-200ms authentication response times
- Compatible with existing httpOnly cookie requirement
- Supports multi-tab session synchronization

### Out of Scope
- Third-party OAuth providers (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Enterprise SSO integration
- Complex multi-tenant authentication

## Technology Options Evaluated

### Option 1: BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) Pattern
**Overview**: Modern security pattern moving all authentication handling to backend, eliminating browser token storage
**Industry Status**: OWASP 2025 recommended approach, current OAuth working group best practice
**Documentation Quality**: Excellent - Microsoft Learn, industry experts, production examples

**Pros**:
- **Security Excellence**: Zero tokens in browser eliminates XSS token theft risk completely
- **Silent Refresh**: Server-side token rotation with seamless user experience
- **Industry Standard**: OAuth working group recommendation, OWASP 2025 aligned
- **ASP.NET Core 9 Native**: Built-in support with OAuth 2.0 PAR (RFC 9126) by default
- **Multi-tab Support**: Automatic session synchronization via shared cookies
- **CSRF Protection**: SameSite=Strict + httpOnly cookies provide comprehensive protection
- **Mobile Friendly**: Cookie-based auth works seamlessly on mobile browsers

**Cons**:
- **Architecture Change**: Requires backend authentication endpoints (/auth/login, /auth/refresh, /auth/logout)
- **Additional Complexity**: Backend manages token lifecycle instead of frontend
- **Cookie Dependency**: Requires proper cookie configuration (already implemented)

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- Safety/Privacy: Excellent - eliminates browser token exposure completely
- Mobile Experience: Perfect - cookies work natively on all mobile browsers
- Learning Curve: Moderate - team must learn server-side auth patterns
- Community Values: Excellent - prioritizes user security and privacy

### Option 2: Enhanced JWT with Refresh Token Rotation
**Overview**: Client-side JWT management with automatic refresh token rotation and memory storage
**Industry Status**: Being phased out by security community, not recommended for new projects
**Documentation Quality**: Good but many sources note security limitations

**Pros**:
- **Familiar Pattern**: React developers understand client-side token management
- **Direct API Access**: Frontend makes direct API calls with JWT headers
- **Flexible Storage**: Can use memory, sessionStorage, or secure patterns
- **Axios Integration**: Well-documented interceptor patterns available

**Cons**:
- **Security Risk**: Any XSS vulnerability exposes tokens regardless of storage method
- **Complex Refresh Logic**: Must handle token rotation, race conditions, and error states
- **Browser Vulnerabilities**: Cannot guarantee security against malicious JavaScript
- **Industry Shift**: Moving away from this pattern - not future-proof
- **Mobile Issues**: More complex session management across mobile browser instances

**WitchCityRope Fit**:
- Safety/Privacy: Poor - inherent browser security risks
- Mobile Experience: Fair - additional complexity for mobile users
- Learning Curve: Low - familiar to React developers
- Community Values: Poor - does not align with privacy-first approach

## Implementation Considerations

### Migration Path
1. **Phase 1**: Implement BFF authentication endpoints in ASP.NET Core API
   - `/auth/login` - Initiate authentication flow
   - `/auth/refresh` - Silent token refresh endpoint  
   - `/auth/logout` - Clear authentication state
   - `/auth/user` - Get current user information

2. **Phase 2**: Update React authentication state management
   - Remove token storage from Zustand store
   - Update Axios interceptors to handle cookie-based auth
   - Implement automatic retry logic for 401 responses
   - Update TanStack Query authentication patterns

3. **Phase 3**: Enhanced security configuration
   - Configure ASP.NET Core cookie settings (httpOnly, secure, SameSite)
   - Implement CSRF protection patterns
   - Add session timeout handling
   - Configure proper CORS policies

**Estimated Timeline**: 1-2 weeks implementation + 1 week testing

### Integration Points
- **ASP.NET Core 9**: Leverage native OAuth 2.0 PAR support for enhanced security
- **React Router v7**: Update protected route patterns to work with cookie authentication
- **TanStack Query**: Implement authentication-aware query patterns
- **Zustand**: Simplify store to manage UI authentication state only
- **Mantine v7**: Update form components for server-side authentication flows

### Performance Impact
- **Network**: +1-2 additional requests for auth endpoints (negligible overhead)
- **Bundle Size**: -5-10KB (removing client-side token management libraries)
- **Runtime**: Improved performance (server handles token logic)
- **Memory**: Reduced memory footprint (no token storage in JavaScript)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Cookie Configuration**: Incorrect SameSite/httpOnly settings could create vulnerabilities
  - **Mitigation**: Use ASP.NET Core 9 defaults, comprehensive testing across browsers

### Medium Risk  
- **CORS Configuration**: Improper CORS setup could break authentication flow
  - **Mitigation**: Documented CORS patterns for BFF, thorough testing

### Low Risk
- **Learning Curve**: Team unfamiliarity with BFF pattern
  - **Monitoring**: Comprehensive documentation and examples provided

## Recommendation

### Primary Recommendation: BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) Pattern
**Confidence Level**: High (90%)

**Rationale**:
1. **Security Excellence**: Eliminates the fundamental security risk of browser token storage that causes the "logout after waiting" issue
2. **Industry Leadership**: Represents current best practice per OWASP 2025 and OAuth working group
3. **Framework Support**: ASP.NET Core 9 provides native support making implementation straightforward
4. **User Experience**: Provides seamless authentication without user disruption
5. **Future-Proof**: Aligns with evolving security standards and browser restrictions

**Implementation Priority**: Immediate - addresses critical user experience issue

### Alternative Recommendations
- **Second Choice**: Enhanced JWT with Memory Storage - Only if BFF implementation blocked
- **Future Consideration**: WebAuthn/Passkeys integration - After BFF implementation complete

## Architecture Discovery Process Validation

**Verified no existing solution in architecture docs**: 
- Checked `/docs/architecture/react-migration/migration-plan.md` - Contains high-level auth strategy but not detailed pattern research
- Checked `/docs/architecture/functional-area-master-index.md` - Authentication marked COMPLETE but refers to implementation, not pattern research
- Checked existing authentication functional area structure - Implementation focused, not 2025 best practices research
- **Conclusion**: This research addresses gap in modern authentication pattern evaluation for React + ASP.NET Core 9.0 stack

**References to existing architecture decisions**:
- Migration plan specifies httpOnly cookies requirement (aligns with BFF recommendation)
- Existing technology stack constraints validated (React 18.3.1, ASP.NET Core 9.0, TanStack Query, Zustand)
- Security requirements from platform context integrated into evaluation criteria
