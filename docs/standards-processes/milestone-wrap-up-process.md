## Overview

This document establishes the comprehensive process for completing project milestones, ensuring proper value extraction, documentation cleanup, progress updates, and smooth transitions between development phases. This process consolidates patterns from successful milestone completions including vertical slice completion, form infrastructure handoffs, and workflow orchestration finalization.

## Milestone Wrap-Up Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Value Preservation**: All critical patterns, lessons, and artifacts must be extracted to permanent locations
2. **Knowledge Transfer**: Complete handoff documentation enables seamless session transitions
3. **Documentation Cleanup**: Archive outdated/confusing work to prevent future confusion
4. **Progress Coordination**: Update all progress tracking documents consistently
5. **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive validation before milestone closure
6. **Lesson Extraction**: Capture all discoveries for future milestone improvements

### Success Criteria
A milestone is complete when:
- All deliverables meet quality gate standards
- Value extraction is verified complete
- Outdated documentation is properly archived
- Progress documents are synchronized
- Next phase preparation is comprehensive
- Git commit captures all milestone work

## Documentation Cleanup Process

### Phase 1: Content Assessment

#### Categorize All Documentation
**KEEP ACTIVE** (Production-Ready Content):

- Session notes consolidated into final documents

**EXTRACT TO ARCHITECTURE** (Long-term Decisions):
- Major technology decisions and rationale
- Architecture pattern adoptions
- Security or performance standards
- Integration patterns and configurations
- Design principles and conventions

## Archival Decision Framework

### Keep vs Archive Decision Matrix

#### KEEP ACTIVE Criteria
- **Current Implementation**: Represents current working solution
- **Team Reference**: Needed by team for ongoing/future development
- **Production Ready**: Complete, validated, and ready for production use
- **Architecture Current**: Reflects current technology and design decisions
- **Process Relevant**: Still applicable to current development workflow

#### ARCHIVE Criteria  
- **Superseded**: Replaced by better/newer implementation or documentation
- **Experimental**: Work that was tried but not adopted
- **Draft/Incomplete**: Preliminary work that was completed elsewhere
- **Technology Outdated**: Based on deprecated or changed technology decisions
- **Process Outdated**: Workflow or process that has been improved/replaced

#### EXTRACT TO ARCHITECTURE Criteria
- **Long-term Impact**: Decisions that affect multiple projects or long-term direction
- **Reusable Standards**: Patterns that should be applied consistently across projects
- **Technology Strategy**: Major framework, tool, or platform decisions
- **Security/Performance**: Standards that must be followed for compliance or optimization
- **Integration Patterns**: How services, APIs, or systems should communicate

### Special Archival Considerations

#### Complex Work Folders
For milestone work with multiple sub-folders and experimental approaches:
1. **Identify Final Implementations**: What code/documentation represents the final working solution
2. **Extract Reusable Patterns**: Move proven patterns to appropriate architecture documentation
3. **Preserve Decision Rationale**: Document why certain approaches were chosen over others
4. **Archive Failed Approaches**: Keep record of what was tried but not adopted (with reasons)
5. **Update Implementation Guides**: Ensure production-ready guides contain all necessary patterns

#### Cross-Functional Impact
When milestone work affects multiple functional areas:
1. **Coordinate Archive Timing**: Ensure all dependent areas have extracted needed information
2. **Update Cross-References**: Fix links in related functional areas to point to preserved content
3. **Notify Stakeholders**: Ensure other teams know where to find preserved patterns
4. **Create Bridge Documentation**: Temporary guides pointing to new locations if needed
