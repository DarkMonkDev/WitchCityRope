## Migration Completion Steps

### 1. Final Test Conversion
- [ ] Convert all remaining miscellaneous tests
- [ ] Verify all tests pass in all three browsers
- [ ] Run full test suite locally
- [ ] Run parallel comparison with Puppeteer

### 2. Visual Regression Baselines
- [ ] Generate baseline images for all visual tests
- [ ] Review baselines for accuracy
- [ ] Commit baselines to repository
- [ ] Document baseline update process

### 3. CI/CD Verification
- [ ] Run full Playwright test suite in CI
- [ ] Verify nightly tests are working
- [ ] Confirm test reports are generated
- [ ] Test failure notifications working

### 4. Performance Validation
- [ ] Measure full suite execution time
- [ ] Compare with Puppeteer baseline
- [ ] Document performance improvements
- [ ] Identify any slow tests for optimization

### 5. Team Enablement
- [ ] Schedule team training session
- [ ] Conduct workshop using training materials
- [ ] Create quick reference cards
- [ ] Set up pair programming sessions

## Puppeteer Decommissioning

### Phase 1: Parallel Running (1 week)
- [ ] Keep both test suites running
- [ ] Monitor for any discrepancies
- [ ] Fix any Playwright test issues
- [ ] Gather team feedback

### Phase 2: Puppeteer Deprecation (1 week)
- [ ] Add deprecation notices to Puppeteer tests
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Remove Puppeteer from CI/CD workflows
- [ ] Archive Puppeteer test results

### Phase 3: Removal (Final)
- [ ] Remove Puppeteer dependencies from package.json
- [ ] Delete Puppeteer test files
- [ ] Remove Puppeteer-specific scripts
- [ ] Update README and contributing guides
- [ ] Create git tag for historical reference

## Post-Migration Tasks

### Optimization
- [ ] Implement test sharding for faster CI
- [ ] Optimize slow tests identified
- [ ] Set up test result trending
- [ ] Configure advanced reporting

### Expansion
- [ ] Add missing test scenarios identified
- [ ] Implement cross-browser specific tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarking tests
- [ ] Create smoke test suite

### Maintenance
- [ ] Set up regular baseline updates
- [ ] Create test maintenance schedule
- [ ] Document common issues and solutions
- [ ] Establish test review process

## Success Criteria

### Functional
- [ ] 100% of tests converted successfully
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD
- [ ] No regression in test coverage
- [ ] Team trained and productive

### Performance
- [ ] Test execution time reduced by 30%+
- [ ] Flaky test rate below 2%
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline under 15 minutes
- [ ] Parallel execution working

### Quality
- [ ] TypeScript providing value
- [ ] Page Objects reducing maintenance
- [ ] Visual tests catching UI changes
- [ ] Better debugging with Playwright tools

## Sign-offs

### Technical
- [ ] Lead Developer approval
- [ ] QA Team approval
- [ ] DevOps approval
- [ ] Security review (if needed)

### Business
- [ ] Project Manager approval
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off
- [ ] Budget confirmation
- [ ] Timeline acceptance
