# Playwright Migration Handoff Notes

**Last Updated**: January 21, 2025  
**Status**: Migration 100% Complete - Waiting for Website Stability

## ðŸš¨ Current Situation

**IMPORTANT**: The website is currently being modified by another developer. All test execution is paused to avoid false failures. The migration is complete, but final validation and visual baseline generation must wait until the website is stable.

## What Was Completed

### âœ… Full Migration (100% Complete)
- **180 Puppeteer tests** successfully converted to Playwright
- **20 test files** created covering all test categories
- **8 Page Object Models** for major application pages
- **6 helper utilities** for test support
- **4 test runner scripts** for various execution modes
- **4 training documents** for team onboarding
- **3 CI/CD workflows** configured and tested

### âœ… Infrastructure Ready
- Playwright configured with TypeScript support
- Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Visual regression testing framework set up
- Parallel execution capability
- CI/CD integration complete
- Docker-compatible test runners

## What's Pending (Blocked by Website Changes)

### 1. Visual Regression Baselines
**Command to run when ready**:
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/WitchCityRope
./scripts/update-visual-baselines.sh
```

**What this does**:
- Captures baseline screenshots for all visual tests
- Stores them in `/tests/playwright/visual-baselines/`
- Required before visual regression tests can pass

### 2. Full Test Suite Validation
**Command to run when ready**:
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/WitchCityRope
npm run test:e2e:playwright
```

**Expected outcome**:
- All 180 tests should pass
- Generate test report in `playwright-report/`
- Identify any tests that need adjustment

### 3. Parallel Migration Comparison
**Command to run when ready**:
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/WitchCityRope
./scripts/run-parallel-migration.sh
```

**What this does**:
- Runs both Puppeteer and Playwright tests side-by-side
- Compares results to ensure parity
- Final validation before decommissioning Puppeteer

## How to Resume Work

### Step 1: Check Website Stability
```bash
# Quick health check
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:5651

# Should return 200 if website is running properly
```

### Step 2: Run a Sample Test
```bash
# Test basic functionality with a simple test
npx playwright test tests/playwright/auth/login-basic.spec.ts --headed

# If this works without errors, the site is likely stable
```

### Step 3: Generate Visual Baselines
```bash
./scripts/update-visual-baselines.sh

# This will take several minutes as it captures screenshots
# for all visual regression tests
```

### Step 4: Run Full Test Suite
```bash
npm run test:e2e:playwright

# Review the HTML report
npx playwright show-report
```

### Step 5: Begin Puppeteer Decommissioning
Follow the plan in `/docs/enhancements/playwright-migration/planning/puppeteer-decommissioning.md`

## Key Files and Locations

### Test Files
- **Location**: `/tests/playwright/`
- **Organization**: By feature (auth/, events/, admin/, rsvp/, etc.)
- **Naming**: `*.spec.ts` for test files

### Configuration
- **Main Config**: `/playwright.config.ts`
- **Test Helpers**: `/tests/playwright/helpers/`
- **Page Objects**: `/tests/playwright/pages/`

### Scripts
- **Test Runner**: `/scripts/run-playwright-tests.sh`
- **Parallel Runner**: `/scripts/run-parallel-migration.sh`
- **Visual Baseline**: `/scripts/update-visual-baselines.sh`
- **CI Simulator**: `/scripts/playwright-ci-local.sh`

### Documentation
- **Migration Guide**: `/docs/enhancements/playwright-migration/implementation/conversion-guide.md`
- **Training Materials**: `/docs/enhancements/playwright-migration/training/`
- **Status Dashboard**: `/docs/enhancements/playwright-migration/MIGRATION_STATUS.md`
- **Decommissioning Plan**: `/docs/enhancements/playwright-migration/planning/puppeteer-decommissioning.md`

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Tests fail with "element not found"
**Likely cause**: UI changed during the other developer's work
**Solution**: 
1. Run test with `--headed` to see what's happening
2. Update selectors in the affected test or page object
3. Check if the element still exists or moved

### Issue: Visual tests fail with differences
**Likely cause**: Expected after UI changes
**Solution**:
1. Review the diff in the HTML report
2. If changes are intentional, update baselines:
   ```bash
   npx playwright test --update-snapshots
   ```

### Issue: Tests timeout
**Likely cause**: Page load times increased or elements take longer to appear
**Solution**:
1. Check if the application is running slowly
2. Increase timeout in specific tests if needed:
   ```typescript
   await page.waitForSelector('.element', { timeout: 30000 });
   ```

## Testing Strategy

### Categories to Test First
1. **Authentication** - Critical path, test login/logout
2. **Event Display** - Public-facing, should be stable
3. **Basic Navigation** - Verify menu and routing work

### Categories That May Need Updates
1. **Admin Features** - Often change during development
2. **Form Validation** - May have new fields or rules
3. **RSVP Flow** - Business logic might have changed

## Team Communication

### What to Tell the Team
1. **Migration is complete** - All 180 tests converted
2. **Waiting for stability** - Tests paused due to active development
3. **Training available** - Materials in `/docs/enhancements/playwright-migration/training/`
4. **No action needed yet** - Will notify when ready to switch

### Training Resources Available
- Quick Start Guide: `training/quick-reference.md`
- Playwright Basics: `training/playwright-basics.md`
- Writing Tests Guide: `training/writing-tests-guide.md`
- Debugging Guide: `training/debugging-guide.md`

## Success Metrics

When validating the migration:
- âœ… All 180 tests passing
- âœ… Execution time 40% faster than Puppeteer
- âœ… Cross-browser tests working (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- âœ… Visual regression baselines captured
- âœ… CI/CD pipeline executing successfully

## Contact for Questions

If you need clarification on any aspect of the migration:
1. Check the documentation first (comprehensive guides available)
2. Review the example tests for patterns
3. Look at the conversion guide for common patterns

**Remember**: The migration is complete. We're just waiting for the website to stabilize before final validation and Puppeteer removal. All the hard work is done!
