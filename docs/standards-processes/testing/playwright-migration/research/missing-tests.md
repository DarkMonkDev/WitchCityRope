  - No results handling

- **Event Discovery**
  - Browse by category

  - Social media login
  - Payment gateway webhooks
  - Email service provider
  - Analytics tracking

## Nice-to-Have Missing Tests

### 10. Performance & Optimization
- **Performance Metrics**
  - Page load time benchmarks
  - Time to interactive
  - Lazy loading verification
  - Image optimization
  - Bundle size monitoring

### 11. Advanced Features
- **Data Operations**
  - Export event attendee list
  - Import member data
  - Export financial reports
  - Backup verification

### 12. Error Scenarios
- **Edge Cases**
  - Network disconnection handling
  - Server error recovery
  - Data validation edge cases
  - Browser back/forward behavior

## Test Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 - Critical Security & Payment (Week 1-2 of new tests)
1. Password Reset Flow
2. Payment Processing
3. Session Management
4. Account Management

### Phase 2 - User Experience (Week 3-4)
1. Profile Management
2. Email Notifications
3. Waitlist Features
4. Basic Search (admin panel)

### Phase 3 - Compliance & Integration (Week 5-6)
1. Accessibility Tests
2. Mobile Responsive Tests
3. Third-Party Integrations
4. Legal Compliance

## Recommendations

### Quick Wins
These tests can be implemented quickly and provide high value:
1. Password reset flow (extends existing login tests)
2. Profile update tests (simple CRUD operations)
3. Email preference management
4. Basic admin search functionality
5. Cookie consent banner

### Complex Implementations
These require more setup but are critical:
1. Payment processing (requires test payment gateway)
2. 2FA implementation (when system is ready)
3. Email notification testing (requires email capture)
4. Recurring events (complex business logic)
5. Real-time notifications (SignalR testing)

### Testing Strategy
1. **Use Test Fixtures**: Set up reusable test data
2. **Mock External Services**: Payment gateways, email providers
3. **Parallel Execution**: Design tests for parallel running
4. **Visual Regression**: Leverage Playwright's screenshot testing
5. **API Testing**: Combine UI tests with API verification

## Estimated Effort

### Total New Tests: ~40-50 tests
- Critical: 15-20 tests (1-2 weeks)
- Important: 15-20 tests (2-3 weeks)
- Nice-to-have: 10-15 tests (1-2 weeks)

### Resource Requirements
- Senior Developer: 4-6 weeks for all tests
- QA Engineer: 1-2 weeks for review and validation
- Infrastructure: Test payment gateway, email service

## Integration with Migration

### Approach Options
1. **Sequential**: Complete migration, then add new tests
2. **Parallel**: Add new tests during migration
3. **Hybrid**: Add critical tests during migration, others after

### Recommended Approach: Hybrid
- Add critical security tests during migration
- Implement payment tests early (high risk)
- Defer nice-to-have tests until after migration
- Use new tests to validate Playwright patterns

## Next Steps
1. Review and prioritize this list with stakeholders
2. Create detailed test cases for Phase 1 tests
3. Set up test infrastructure (payment, email)
4. Begin implementation alongside migration
