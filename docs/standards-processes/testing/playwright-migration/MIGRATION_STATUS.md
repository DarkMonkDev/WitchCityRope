## Timeline & Milestones

### Completed Milestones ‚úÖ
- [x] Week 0: Planning & POC (January 21)
- [x] Week 1: Authentication Tests (January 21)
- [x] Week 1: Event Management Tests (January 21)

### Upcoming Milestones üéØ
- [ ] Week 2: Admin Management Tests
- [ ] Week 3: RSVP & Ticket Tests
- [ ] Week 4: Form Validation Tests
- [ ] Week 5: Diagnostic & Utility Tests
- [ ] Week 6: API & Integration Tests
- [ ] Week 7: Missing Test Implementation
- [ ] Week 8: Cleanup & Optimization
- [ ] Week 9: Documentation & Training
- [ ] Week 10: Puppeteer Removal & Cutover

## Key Decisions Made

1. **TypeScript**: All tests use TypeScript for type safety
2. **Page Objects**: Mandatory pattern for maintainability
3. **Centralized Location**: All tests in `/tests/playwright/`
4. **Cross-Browser**: All tests run on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
5. **Parallel First**: Designed for parallel execution from start

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
- None identified

### Risks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pace Risk**: Current pace may be unsustainable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Coverage Risk**: Some Puppeteer tests may be outdated
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Training Risk**: Team needs Playwright training soon

## How to Run Tests

```bash
# Run all Playwright tests
npm run test:e2e:playwright

# Run specific category
./scripts/run-playwright-tests.sh -s auth

# Run in UI mode
npm run test:e2e:playwright:ui

# Run both frameworks in parallel
./scripts/run-parallel-migration.sh

# Simulate CI locally
./scripts/playwright-ci-local.sh
```

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate** (This Week):
   - [ ] Convert admin management tests (25 tests)
   - [ ] Create team training materials
   - [ ] Set up nightly test runs

2. **Next Week**:
   - [ ] Convert RSVP tests (15 tests)
   - [ ] Convert validation tests (20 tests)
   - [ ] Create visual regression baselines

3. **Following Week**:
   - [ ] Convert remaining tests
   - [ ] Performance benchmarking
   - [ ] Team training sessions
