# Puppeteer Decommissioning Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for safely decommissioning Puppeteer tests now that all 180 tests have been successfully converted to Playwright.

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ All 180 Puppeteer tests converted to Playwright
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure fully operational
- ‚è≥ Waiting for website stability to run full test suite
- ‚è≥ Visual regression baselines pending

## Decommissioning Timeline

### Phase 1: Validation Period (Days 1-3)
**Status**: Ready to start once website is stable

#### Actions:
1. **Run Both Test Suites in Parallel**
   ```bash
   # Use the parallel migration script
   ./scripts/run-parallel-migration.sh
   ```

2. **Compare Results**
   - Verify same tests pass/fail
   - Compare execution times
   - Check for any behavioral differences

3. **Team Validation**
   - Have team members run Playwright tests
   - Gather feedback on experience
   - Address any concerns

#### Success Criteria:
- [ ] All Playwright tests passing
- [ ] No functionality gaps identified
- [ ] Team comfortable with Playwright

### Phase 2: Transition Period (Days 4-7)
**Goal**: Gradually shift from Puppeteer to Playwright

#### Actions:
1. **Update CI/CD Pipelines**
   ```yaml
   # Add comment to Puppeteer workflow
   # DEPRECATED: This workflow will be removed on [DATE]
   # Please use .github/workflows/e2e-playwright-js.yml instead
   ```

2. **Update Documentation**
   - Add deprecation notices to Puppeteer test files
   - Update README.md with Playwright instructions
   - Update contributing guidelines

3. **Disable Puppeteer in CI** (Day 5)
   - Comment out Puppeteer test execution
   - Keep workflow file for reference
   - Monitor for any issues

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] Deprecation notices added
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Team notified via email/Slack

### Phase 3: Removal (Day 8)
**Goal**: Complete removal of Puppeteer

#### Pre-removal Checklist:
- [ ] Create git tag for historical reference: `pre-puppeteer-removal`
- [ ] Backup test results and reports
- [ ] Final team approval received

#### Removal Steps:

1. **Remove Puppeteer Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm uninstall puppeteer
   npm uninstall puppeteer-core
   ```

2. **Delete Puppeteer Test Files**
   ```bash
   # Archive first
   tar -czf puppeteer-tests-archive.tar.gz tests/e2e/tests/e2e/
   
   # Then remove
   rm -rf tests/e2e/tests/e2e/*.js
   ```

3. **Remove Puppeteer Scripts**
   - Delete Puppeteer-specific test runners
   - Remove Puppeteer helper functions
   - Clean up package.json scripts

4. **Update CI/CD**
   - Delete `.github/workflows/e2e-puppeteer-tests.yml`
   - Remove any Puppeteer references from other workflows

5. **Clean Up Documentation**
   - Remove Puppeteer sections from docs
   - Archive Puppeteer-specific guides

## File Removal List

### Test Files to Remove
```
/tests/e2e/tests/e2e/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ *.js (all JavaScript test files)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test-helpers.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared-login.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test-suite-organizer.js
```

### Scripts to Update
- `package.json` - Remove Puppeteer scripts:
  - `test:e2e:puppeteer`
  - Any other Puppeteer-related scripts

### CI/CD Files to Remove
- `.github/workflows/e2e-puppeteer-tests.yml`
- Any Puppeteer-specific workflow files

### Documentation to Update
- `/README.md` - Remove Puppeteer references
- `/docs/testing/E2E_TESTING_PROCEDURES.md`
- `/tests/e2e/TEST_REGISTRY.md`

## Risk Mitigation

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise post-removal:

1. **Immediate Rollback** (< 1 hour)
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   npm install
   ```

2. **Restore from Archive**
   ```bash
   tar -xzf puppeteer-tests-archive.tar.gz
   npm install puppeteer@24.14.0
   ```

3. **Re-enable CI/CD**
   - Restore workflow files from git history
   - Re-enable test execution

### Monitoring Plan
- Monitor test execution for 1 week post-removal
- Track any test failures or flakiness
- Keep archive for 30 days

## Communication Plan
