## Overall Test Health

### Summary Dashboard
```
Unit Tests (Core):        âœ… 99.5% (202/203 passing)
Unit Tests (API):         âœ… 95%   (117/123 passing) 
Integration Tests:        ðŸŸ¡ 86%   (115/133 passing)
E2E Tests (Playwright):   ðŸŸ¡ 83%   (150/180 passing)
Performance Tests:        âœ… Basic coverage implemented
```

### Build Status
- **Solution Build**: âœ… Successful
- **Test Projects Build**: âœ… All building
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: ðŸŸ¡ Needs E2E stabilization

## Detailed Status by Test Type

### 1. Unit Tests âœ… Excellent

#### Core Domain Tests (99.5% passing)
**What's Working:**
- All entity validation tests passing
- Business rule enforcement verified
- Value objects properly tested
- Domain services fully covered

**Single Skipped Test:**
- `EventTests.Should_Not_Allow_Past_Event_Creation` - Skipped for test scenarios

#### API Tests (95% passing)
**What's Working:**
- Authentication services tested
- JWT token generation verified
- Service layer logic covered
- Command/Query handlers tested

**Known Failures (6 tests):**
- Event date validation edge cases
- Concurrent user update scenarios
- Some async timing issues

### 2. Integration Tests ðŸŸ¡ Good

**Test Infrastructure**: âœ… PostgreSQL with TestContainers working well

**What's Working (115 passing):**
- Database operations
- Repository patterns
- Authentication flows
- Basic CRUD operations
- Health check system

**Known Issues (18 failing):**
- Missing navigation routes for new pages
- Some Blazor component initialization issues
- Occasional container startup timeouts

### 3. E2E Tests ðŸŸ¡ Improving

**Migration Status**: âœ… 100% migrated from Puppeteer to Playwright

**What's Working (150/180 passing):**
- Login and registration flows
- Basic event browsing
- Admin dashboard access
- User profile management
- Role-based authorization

**Problem Areas (30 failing):**
- Event RSVP flow (intermittent failures)
- Payment integration tests (Stripe test mode issues)
- Visual regression tests (baselines need update)
- Some mobile responsive tests

### 4. Performance Tests âœ… Basic

**Current Coverage:**
- Login endpoint load testing
- Event listing performance
- Basic stress testing

**Gaps:**
- No API performance benchmarks
- Missing database query performance tests
- No frontend performance metrics

## Recent Changes Affecting Tests

### Positive Changes
1. **PostgreSQL TestContainers**: Eliminated in-memory database issues
2. **Playwright Migration**: More stable than Puppeteer
3. **Health Check System**: Ensures test readiness
4. **Unique Test Data**: Reduced flaky tests

### Challenges
1. **Blazor Server Testing**: Component testing still evolving
2. **Container Startup**: Occasional timeouts in CI
3. **Test Data Management**: Need better cleanup strategies

## Action Items for Test Improvement

### High Priority
1. **Fix Navigation Routes**: Add missing pages causing integration test failures
2. **Stabilize E2E Tests**: Fix flaky RSVP and payment tests
3. **Update Visual Baselines**: Playwright screenshot updates needed

### Medium Priority
1. **Consolidate Web Test Projects**: Three separate projects need merging
2. **Improve Test Data Management**: Better isolation between tests
3. **Add API Performance Tests**: Establish performance baselines

### Low Priority
1. **Increase E2E Coverage**: Add more edge case scenarios
2. **Documentation**: Update test writing guidelines
3. **CI/CD Optimization**: Parallel test execution

## Test Execution Tips

### For Developers
```bash
# Quick unit test check before commit
dotnet test tests/WitchCityRope.Core.Tests/ --no-build

# Full test suite (takes ~10 minutes)
./run-all-tests.sh
```

### For CI/CD
```yaml
# Recommended test order
1. Unit tests (fast feedback)
2. Integration tests (database verification)
3. E2E tests (full system validation)
4. Performance tests (optional on main branch)
```

## Monthly Test Metrics

### July 2025
- Tests added: +45 (Playwright migration)
- Tests fixed: 23
- Average test run time: 8.5 minutes
- Flaky test rate: 5%

### Goals for August 2025
- Achieve 90% passing rate across all suites
- Reduce test run time to < 7 minutes
- Flaky test rate < 3%
