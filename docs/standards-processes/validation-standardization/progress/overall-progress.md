- ✅ WcrInputSelect
- ✅ WcrInputTextArea
- ✅ WcrInputCheckbox
- ✅ WcrInputNumber
- ✅ WcrInputDate
- ✅ WcrInputRadio

### Time Tracking
- Session 1: 1.5 hours (Infrastructure)
- Session 2: 2 hours (Login page)
- Session 3: 1.5 hours (Register page + Login UX update)
- Session 4: 2.75 hours (ForgotPassword + ResetPassword + Documentation)
- Session 5: 1.5 hours (ChangePassword + ManageEmail)
- Session 6: 1 hour (ManageProfile + LoginWith2fa + DeletePersonalData + WcrInputCheckbox)
- Session 7: 0.75 hours (WcrInputNumber + WcrInputDate + VettingApplication)
- Session 8: 1.17 hours (WcrInputRadio + EventRegistrationModal + MemberOverview + CreateIncidentModal)
- Session 9: 0.58 hours (UpdateIncidentStatusModal + AssignIncidentModal + AddIncidentNoteModal)
- **Total so far**: 12.75 hours

### Code Statistics
- Lines of code written: ~8,700
- Files created: 44
- Tests written: 10
- Forms converted: 16/20+ (80%)
- Modal components extracted: 4 (from IncidentManagement)

## Risk Assessment

### On Track ✅
- Infrastructure proven solid
- First conversion successful
- No breaking changes
- Timeline realistic

### Potential Risks
- Register page complexity (mitigated by good planning)
- Testing coverage (addressed in Phase 4)
- jQuery removal impacts (gradual migration reduces risk)

## Next Milestones

### Short Term (This Week)
1. Complete Register page conversion
2. Convert 2-3 more simple Identity pages
3. Create first round of Puppeteer tests

### Medium Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. Complete all Identity pages
2. Start application form conversions
3. Remove jQuery from converted pages

### Long Term (6 Weeks)
1. All forms converted
2. jQuery completely removed
3. Full test coverage
4. Documentation complete

## Success Indicators

✅ **Achieved**
- Validation infrastructure working perfectly
- First page converted successfully
- Zero breaking changes
- Improved user experience

🎯 **Target**
- 100% form conversion
- 0 jQuery dependencies
- >90% test coverage
- <200ms validation response time

## Additional Components
- [x] MemberOverview.razor - ✅ COMPLETE (Session 8)

## Conclusion

The validation standardization project continues to make excellent progress. Phase 2 (Identity Pages) is 100% complete, and Phase 3 (Application Forms) has reached 50% completion. We've successfully converted 13 of 20+ forms (65%) and created all 11 planned validation components. The component library is now complete, providing everything needed to standardize validation across the entire application. 

The infrastructure has proven robust and flexible, handling various scenarios:
- Simple forms (3 fields in MemberOverview)
- Complex modals (EventRegistrationModal with sliding scale pricing)
- Extracted components from large pages (CreateIncidentModal from 1380-line file)
- Integration with existing UI frameworks (maintaining Syncfusion where appropriate)

At the current pace, the entire project remains on track for completion within the 6-week timeline.
