## Date: January 11, 2025
## Session Time: ~1.5 hours (1:20 PM - 2:50 PM EST)

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Register Page Approach Decision ✅
- Analyzed tabbed vs separate page approaches
- Decided to keep separate pages for better UX and technical benefits
- Documented decision rationale in `/decisions/register-page-approach.md`

### 2. Login Page UX Update ✅
- Removed confusing tab navigation
- Added "New to Witch City Rope?" section with prominent Create Account button
- Improved visual hierarchy and user flow
- Maintained consistent branding

### 3. Register Page Conversion ✅

  - Age confirmation checkbox (21+ requirement)
  - Terms acceptance checkbox
- Dual routing support (`/register` and `/Identity/Account/Register`)
- Google OAuth integration preserved
- Real-time validation with WCR components
- Mobile responsive design

## Technical Implementation

### Key Features
1. **Scene Name Validation**: Integrated with ValidationService for uniqueness checking
2. **Age Verification**: Required checkbox for 21+ confirmation
3. **Terms Acceptance**: Links to terms and privacy policy pages
4. **Email Confirmation**: Generates confirmation token and sends email
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error messages for all scenarios
6. **Loading States**: Visual feedback during account creation

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Separate Pages**: Better than tabs for:
   - Clear user intent
   - Bookmarkable URLs
   - Browser back button functionality
   - Better SEO
   - Simpler state management

2. **Validation Approach**:
   - Client-side with DataAnnotations
   - Server-side uniqueness checks
   - Real-time feedback with WCR components

## UI/UX Improvements

### Login Page
- **Before**: Confusing inactive tab for "Create Account"
- **After**: Clear secondary CTA button with "New to Witch City Rope?" section

### Register Page
- Consistent header design with Login page
- Clear form progression
- Helpful field descriptions
- Strong visual hierarchy
- Prominent age/terms requirements

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Test the Register page thoroughly
2. Fix any compilation or runtime issues
3. Create basic Puppeteer test

### Short Term
1. Convert ForgotPassword page
2. Convert ResetPassword page
3. Create comprehensive test suite

### Documentation Updates
- ✅ Updated overall progress (25% Identity pages complete)
- ✅ Created session summary
- ✅ Documented architecture decision

## Metrics
- **Forms Converted**: 2/17 (11.8%)
- **Identity Pages**: 2/8 (25%)
- **Code Written**: ~800 lines
- **Files Created**: 3
- **Time Spent**: 1.5 hours

## Key Learnings
1. **UX Decisions Matter**: Tabs look nice but separate pages work better
2. **Consistency is Key**: Both auth pages now have matching design
3. **Validation Integration**: WCR components work seamlessly with registration
4. **Identity Integration**: Can use simplified user creation with Identity
