# Documentation Standards

This document defines the standards and conventions for documentation within the WitchCityRope project.

## Lessons Learned Standards

### File Naming Convention

Lessons learned files follow a strict naming convention to ensure consistency and discoverability:

- **Pattern**: `[domain]-lessons-learned.md`
- **Location**: `docs/lessons-learned/[domain]-lessons-learned.md`

### Supported Domains

The following domains are recognized for lessons learned documentation:

- `backend-lessons-learned.md` - Backend development, API design, and server-side logic
- `frontend-lessons-learned.md` - Frontend development, UI components, and client-side functionality
- `testing-lessons-learned.md` - Testing strategies, test automation, and quality assurance
- `database-lessons-learned.md` - Database design, migrations, and data management
- `devops-lessons-learned.md` - Deployment, infrastructure, and operational concerns
- `security-lessons-learned.md` - Security patterns, authentication, and authorization
- `performance-lessons-learned.md` - Performance optimization and monitoring
- `integration-lessons-learned.md` - Third-party integrations and API connections
- `ui-ux-lessons-learned.md` - User interface and user experience design
- `architecture-lessons-learned.md` - System architecture and design decisions

### Standard Format for Lessons Learned Entries

Each lessons learned file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# [Domain] Lessons Learned

## Overview
Brief description of the domain and purpose of this document.

## Lessons Learned

### [Lesson Title] - [Date]

**Context**: Brief description of the situation or problem.

**What We Learned**: Key insights and discoveries.

**Action Items**: 
- Specific actions to take in future similar situations
- Process improvements
- Documentation updates needed

**Impact**: How this lesson affects future work.

**Tags**: #keyword1 #keyword2 #keyword3

---

### [Next Lesson Title] - [Date]
[Continue with same format...]
```

### Entry Guidelines

1. **Date Format**: Use ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) for consistency
2. **Context**: Provide enough background for future readers to understand the situation
3. **Actionable**: Each lesson should include specific, actionable takeaways
4. **Tagged**: Use consistent tags to enable cross-referencing and searching
5. **Impact**: Clearly state how this lesson changes future approach

### Common Tags

Use these standardized tags to categorize lessons:

- `#critical` - Critical issues that caused significant problems
- `#process` - Process improvements and workflow changes
- `#tooling` - Tool selection and configuration lessons
- `#debugging` - Debugging techniques and troubleshooting
- `#performance` - Performance-related insights
- `#security` - Security considerations and best practices
- `#integration` - Third-party service integration lessons
- `#testing` - Testing strategy and implementation insights
- `#deployment` - Deployment and infrastructure lessons
- `#communication` - Team communication and coordination

## File Organization

### Active Lessons Learned
- **Location**: `docs/lessons-learned/`
- **Purpose**: Current, relevant lessons that actively inform development decisions
- **Maintenance**: Regularly reviewed and updated

### Archived Lessons
- **Location**: `docs/archive/obsolete-lessons/`
- **Purpose**: Historical lessons that are no longer applicable but preserved for reference
- **Criteria for Archiving**:
  - Technology has been completely replaced
  - Process is no longer used
  - Lesson is superseded by newer approaches
  - Context is no longer relevant to current system

### Migration Process

When archiving lessons learned:

1. Move the file to `docs/archive/obsolete-lessons/`
2. Add a header indicating archive date and reason
3. Update any cross-references in active documentation
4. Add entry to archive index if it exists

## Template Usage

A template file is provided at `docs/lessons-learned/TEMPLATE-lessons-learned.md` to ensure consistency when creating new domain-specific lessons learned files.

## Review and Maintenance

### Regular Review Schedule
- **Monthly**: Review recent entries for actionability and relevance
- **Quarterly**: Assess overall structure and identify patterns
- **Annually**: Archive obsolete lessons and reorganize as needed

### Quality Standards
- Entries must be specific and actionable
- Context must be sufficient for future understanding
- Each lesson should include measurable impact when possible
- Cross-references to related documentation should be included

## Integration with Development Process

### When to Document Lessons
- After resolving significant technical challenges
- Following post-mortem meetings
- When discovering better approaches to existing problems
- After completing major features or refactoring efforts
- During code reviews when patterns are identified

### Linking to Other Documentation
- Reference specific files in `/docs/functional-areas/` when applicable
- Link to relevant ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)
- Cross-reference with troubleshooting guides
- Connect to testing documentation and standards

## Compliance and Enforcement

This standard is enforced through:
- Code review processes
- Documentation audits
- Template usage requirements
- Regular team review sessions

## Multi-File Lessons Learned Management (MANDATORY)

### File Size Limits
- **Maximum file size**: ~2,000 lines (conservative limit for 25,000 token Read limit)
- **Check before writing**: Use `wc -l filename` to check line count
- **STOP if can't read**: DO NOT continue work if lessons learned files fail to load

### Multi-File Structure
When lessons learned files exceed size limits, they MUST be split:
- Part 1: `[agent]-lessons-learned.md` (original file)
- Part 2: `[agent]-lessons-learned-2.md`
- Part 3: `[agent]-lessons-learned-3.md`
- Continue sequential numbering as needed

### Reading Protocol (MANDATORY)
1. Read Part 1 header to get file count
2. Read ALL files in sequence
3. **IF ANY FILE FAILS TO READ**: STOP IMMEDIATELY and:
   - Create the missing/broken file if it doesn't exist
   - Split the file if it's too large
   - Update Part 1 header
   - THEN re-read all files before continuing

### Writing Protocol (MANDATORY)
1. ALWAYS write to the LAST file in the series
2. Before writing, check: `wc -l [last-file].md`
3. If > 2,000 lines:
   - Create next numbered file
   - Update Part 1 header with new count
   - Write to the NEW file

### Part 1 Header Format (REQUIRED)
```
## ðŸ“š MULTI-FILE LESSONS LEARNED
**Files**: 3 total
**Read ALL**: Part 1, Part 2, Part 3
**Write to**: Part 3 ONLY
**Max size**: 2,000 lines per file (NOT 2,500)
**IF READ FAILS**: STOP and fix per documentation-standards.md
```

### HARD BLOCK ENFORCEMENT (CRITICAL)

**STARTUP VALIDATION GATE:**
1. Set flag: `LESSONS_LEARNED_READABLE=false`
2. Attempt to read ALL lessons learned files
3. If ANY file fails with token limit error:
   - STOP IMMEDIATELY
   - DO NOT PROCEED WITH ANY WORK
   - FIX THE PROBLEM using the procedure below
4. Only when ALL files read successfully: `LESSONS_LEARNED_READABLE=true`
5. ONLY proceed with work if flag is true

**FIX PROCEDURE When File Too Large:**
1. Check current line count: `wc -l [filename]`
2. If Part 1 > 2,000 lines:
   - Move content from line 2,001 onward to Part 2
   - Update Part 1 header with new file count
3. If Part 2 > 2,000 lines:
   - Create Part 3
   - Move excess content
   - Update Part 1 header
4. Re-read ALL files to verify they work
5. Only then proceed with original task
