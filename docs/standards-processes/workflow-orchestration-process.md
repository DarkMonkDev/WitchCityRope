## Overview

This document is THE authoritative source for the WitchCityRope AI workflow orchestration process. All agents must reference this document for workflow procedures, quality gates, and coordination patterns.

## 5-Phase Workflow Definition

### Phase 1: Requirements & Planning
**Quality Gate Target**: 95% completion
**Mandatory Human Review**: After Business Requirements (BEFORE any design work)

#### Phase Sequence
1. **Business Requirements** (business-requirements agent)
   - Platform analysis and user needs assessment
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - **MANDATORY HUMAN REVIEW CHECKPOINT** - MUST PAUSE for approval
   - **CRITICAL**: NO other work until approval received

#### Deliverables
- Business requirements document: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/requirements/business-requirements.md`
- Phase 1 review document: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/reviews/phase1-requirements-review.md`

**NOTE**: Functional Specification and UI Design are moved to Phase 2 for proper sequencing.

### Phase 2: Design & Architecture
**Quality Gate Target**: 90% completion
**MANDATORY SEQUENCING**: UI Design FIRST, then all other designs

#### Phase Sequence (CRITICAL ORDER)
1. **UI Design** (ui-designer agent) - ABSOLUTE FIRST PRIORITY
   - Create visual design and wireframes based on approved business requirements
   - **MANDATORY HUMAN REVIEW CHECKPOINT** - MUST PAUSE after UI design
   - **CRITICAL**: NO other design work until UI approval received

2. **Post-UI Approval**: All other design work may proceed
   - **Functional Specification** (business-requirements agent) - based on approved UI
   - **Database design** (database-designer agent) - informed by UI data needs
   - **API design** (api-designer agent) - planned
   - **Technical architecture** (react-developer agent) - informed by UI patterns

**Rationale**: UI design decisions fundamentally inform all technical specifications. User interface patterns determine data models, API contracts, and technical architecture. Starting with UI ensures all subsequent design work is aligned with user experience requirements.

#### Agent Coordination
- ui-designer: UI/UX specifications (MUST BE COMPLETED FIRST)
- database-designer: Database schema and migrations (after UI approval)
- api-designer: API contract specifications (planned)
- blazor-architect: System architecture design (planned)

#### Deliverables
- UI design specifications: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/design/ui-design.md` (FIRST)
- UI design review document: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/reviews/ui-design-review.md` (HUMAN REVIEW)
- Functional specification: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/requirements/functional-specification.md` (after UI approval)
- Database schema: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/design/database-design.md` (after UI approval)
- Technical architecture: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/design/technical-design.md` (after UI approval)
- Phase 2 review document: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/reviews/phase2-design-review.md`

### Phase 3: Implementation
**Quality Gate Target**: 85% completion
**Mandatory Human Review**: After First Vertical Slice Implementation

#### Agent Coordination
- blazor-developer: UI component implementation
- backend-developer: API services and business logic
- Maximum 2 agents working simultaneously

#### Deliverables
- Working code implementation
- Unit tests for all components
- Component documentation
- Vertical slice demonstration
- Phase 3 review document: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/reviews/phase3-implementation-review.md`

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation
**Quality Gate Target**: 100% completion (all tests must pass)
**NO Human Review Required**: Automatic delegation to test-executor

#### Critical Delegation Rules
- **MANDATORY**: All testing delegated to test-executor agent
- **NEVER**: Run tests directly via bash commands
- **TEST-FIX CYCLE**: test-executor → specialized developer → test-executor
- **File Path Validation**: Check test vs source file patterns before delegation

#### Testing Workflow
```
1. Delegate to test-executor: Run all test suites
2. Receive results: Pass/fail status with detailed failure info
3. Delegate fixes based on file patterns:
   - Source files (/src/) → backend-developer or blazor-developer
   - Test files (test patterns) → test-developer
   - Mixed errors → Split delegations
4. Return to step 1 until all tests pass
```

#### Deliverables
- All tests passing (verified by test-executor)
- Performance validation
- Code review completion
- Phase 4 review document: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/reviews/phase4-testing-review.md`

### Phase 5: Finalization
**Quality Gate Target**: 100% completion
**Focus**: Documentation, knowledge capture, and MANDATORY cleanup

#### Critical Finalization Steps
1. **Documentation Completion**
2. **Git Cleanup and Branch Management** (Git-Manager delegation)
3. **Final Quality Validation**

#### Mandatory Git Cleanup Process
- **IMMEDIATE**: After PR merge confirmation
- **DELEGATION**: Git-manager agent performs cleanup
- **VERIFICATION**: Cleanup completion required before workflow end
- **NO EXCEPTIONS**: Clean repository state required

#### Deliverables
- Updated main PROGRESS.md
- Feature documentation complete
- Lessons learned captured
- **VERIFIED GIT CLEANUP** (mandatory)
- Improvement suggestions documented
- Final workflow summary: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/reviews/workflow-completion-summary.md`

## Mandatory Human Review Points

### 1. After Business Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **MUST PAUSE**: Wait for explicit human approval
- **BEFORE**: Creating functional specification
- **Review Document**: Business requirements review with approval checklist
- **Approval Required**: Product Manager or Business Stakeholder

### 2. After UI Design (CRITICAL)
- **MUST PAUSE**: Wait for explicit human approval  
- **BEFORE**: ALL other design work (functional specification, database, API, technical)
- **BEFORE**: Any implementation planning
- **Review Document**: UI design review with mockup approval
- **Approval Required**: UI/UX Stakeholder or Product Manager
- **Impact**: UI decisions fundamentally shape all technical specifications and architecture

### 3. After Vertical Slice (CRITICAL)
- **MUST PAUSE**: Wait for explicit human approval
- **BEFORE**: Full feature implementation rollout
- **Review Document**: Vertical slice implementation review
- **Approval Required**: Technical Lead or Project Manager

### 4. Exception: Testing Phase
- **NO PAUSE REQUIRED**: Direct delegation to test-executor
- **AUTOMATIC**: Test-fix cycle coordination
- **HUMAN INVOLVEMENT**: Only if max iterations reached

## Quality Gate Standards

### Calculation Method
```
Quality Score = (Completed Criteria / Total Criteria) × 100
```

### Quality Gate Enforcement
- **PASS**: Score meets or exceeds target percentage
- **FAIL**: Score below target, human intervention required
- **OVERRIDE**: Human can approve with documented reason

### Default Quality Targets by Work Type
- **Feature Development**: R:95% → D:90% → I:85% → T:100%
- **Bug Fixes**: R:80% → D:70% → I:75% → T:100%
- **Hotfixes**: R:70% → D:60% → I:70% → T:100%
- **Documentation**: R:85% → D:N/A → I:N/A → T:90%
- **Refactoring**: R:90% → D:85% → I:80% → T:100%

## File Creation and Naming Standards

### Root Directory Rules (CRITICAL)
- **ONLY ALLOWED**: README.md, PROGRESS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md
- **NEVER CREATE**: Any other files in project root
- **IMMEDIATE ACTION**: Relocate violations and update file registry

### Functional Area Structure
```
/docs/functional-areas/[feature-name]/
├── requirements/        # Business requirements and specs
├── design/             # UI, database, API, technical designs
├── implementation/     # Code implementation notes
├── testing/           # Test plans and results
├── reviews/           # Human review documents and approvals
├── lessons-learned/   # Feature-specific lessons
└── progress.md        # Phase tracking and coordination
```

### File Naming Conventions
- **Documents**: `feature-name-aspect.md`
- **Dates**: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- **Reviews**: `phase[X]-[phase-name]-review.md`
- **Special**: `README.md`, `TODO.md` (uppercase for special files)

### Full Path Requirements
- **ALL file links**: Must use full absolute paths
- **Format**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/...`
- **Clickable**: Format as `[Description](/full/path/to/file)`
- **Validation**: Verify all links work before document completion

## Agent Delegation Patterns

### File Path Discovery Protocol
1. **ALWAYS**: Get paths from librarian's master index first
2. **NEVER**: Let agents search for files themselves
3. **PASS**: Exact paths in delegation prompts
4. **UPDATE**: Master index when functional areas change

### Delegation Prompt Template
```
Task: [agent-name]
Prompt: [specific instructions]

Required Reading:
- Agent lessons learned: /docs/lessons-learned/[agent]-lessons-learned.md
- [Relevant process documents]

File Paths:
- [Exact path 1]: Purpose
- [Exact path 2]: Purpose

Context: [Current project phase and feature description]
```

### Agent Startup Requirements
- **MANDATORY**: Read agent-specific lessons learned file first
- **KNOWLEDGE**: Sub-agents don't read CLAUDE.md automatically
- **COMMUNICATION**: Include essential constraints in delegation prompts

## Docker Operations Integration

### Mandatory Docker Guide Reading
**EVERY Docker-related delegation MUST include:**
```
MANDATORY: Read /docs/guides-setup/docker-operations-guide.md before ANY Docker operations.
Follow the guide exactly for all container procedures.
Update the guide if you discover new procedures.
```

### Docker Documentation References
- **Central Architecture**: `/docs/architecture/docker-architecture.md`
- **Operations Guide**: `/docs/guides-setup/docker-operations-guide.md`

## Progress Tracking Standards

### Update Frequency
- At each phase boundary
- After human reviews
- When blockers encountered
- Phase completion

### Main PROGRESS.md Format
```markdown
## [Date] - [Feature Name] - ORCHESTRATED
**Type**: [Feature/Bug/Hotfix/Docs/Refactor]
**Branch**: feature/[date]-[description]  
**Status**: Phase [X] - [Status]
**Quality Gates**: R:[X%] D:[X%] I:[X%] T:[X%]
**Next Review**: [After requirements/After vertical slice/None]
```

### Detailed Progress in Functional Area
- Track ALL decisions and rationale
- Document blockers and resolutions
- Record agent outputs and reviews
- Capture human feedback and approval

## Success Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators
- Time per phase
- Quality gate achievement rates
- Number of retries needed
- Human intervention frequency
- Test coverage achieved
- Documentation completeness

### Continuous Improvement
- Collect agent improvement suggestions
- Store in `/.claude/workflow-data/improvements/`
- Consolidate and review monthly
- Update process based on learnings

## Critical Violation Responses

### Immediate Action Required
1. **Root directory pollution**: Relocate and alert
2. **Quality gate failures**: Human review required
3. **Missing human approvals**: STOP workflow immediately
4. **Test delegation violations**: Restart with proper delegation
5. **File registry gaps**: Add entries and investigate

### Escalation Procedures
- **Technical issues**: Escalate to appropriate developer agent
- **Process violations**: Document and update prevention measures
- **Quality concerns**: Require human review and approval
- **Workflow blockage**: Human intervention and decision required

## Workflow Data Management

### Storage Locations
- **Active work**: `/.claude/workflow-data/active/`
- **Completed work**: `/.claude/workflow-data/completed/`
- **Templates**: `/.claude/workflow-data/templates/`
- **Improvements**: `/.claude/workflow-data/improvements/`

### Data Retention
- Active work: Until phase completion
- Completed work: Permanent archive
- Improvements: Review quarterly
- Templates: Update as processes evolve
