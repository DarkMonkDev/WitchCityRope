# PROGRESS.md Maintenance Process

## Overview

This document establishes a process for maintaining the PROGRESS.md file to prevent it from becoming unwieldy and difficult to navigate. The goal is to keep PROGRESS.md focused on current development while preserving historical context in appropriate locations.

## The Problem

Over time, PROGRESS.md can grow to become extremely large (e.g., 109KB with 2,388 lines), making it difficult to:
- Find current development information
- Understand what's actively being worked on
- Navigate effectively for new developers
- Extract architectural decisions for proper documentation

## The Solution

### Regular Maintenance Schedule

**Monthly Review**: At the end of each month, evaluate PROGRESS.md for size and relevance:
- If the file exceeds 50KB or becomes hard to navigate
- If historical sessions are no longer relevant to current development
- If architectural decisions need to be extracted

### Maintenance Process

#### 1. Analyze Current Content
```bash
# Check file size
ls -lh PROGRESS.md

# Count lines
wc -l PROGRESS.md
```

#### 2. Identify Content Categories

**Keep in PROGRESS.md (Current Development):**
- Active development sessions (last 3-6 months)
- Current issues and blockers
- Recent architectural changes still relevant
- Ongoing feature development
- Current status and next steps

**Move to Historical Archive:**
- Completed development sessions older than 6 months
- Bug fixes for issues no longer relevant
- Environment setup procedures that are outdated
- Deprecated implementations
- Legacy system documentation

**Extract to Architecture Documentation:**
- Major architectural decisions
- Technology stack changes
- Design pattern implementations
- Infrastructure choices
- Testing strategy decisions

#### 3. Create Historical Archive

**Location**: `/docs/development/development-history-YYYY-MM.md`

**Format**:
```markdown
# Development History Archive - [Date Range]

## Archive Information
- **Extracted from**: PROGRESS.md
- **Archive Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
- **Archived by**: [Developer Name]
- **Content Period**: [Start Date] to [End Date]

## Content Summary
Brief description of what major work was completed in this period.

## For Current Development Status
See the main [PROGRESS.md](../../PROGRESS.md) file.

# Archived Development Sessions

[Historical content goes here]
```

#### 4. Update Architecture Documentation

**Location**: `/docs/architecture/decisions.md`

**Format**: Follow existing ADR (Architecture Decision Record) format:
```markdown
### ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Status:** Accepted/Deprecated/Superseded

**Context:**  
What problem were we solving?

**Decision:**  
What did we decide to do?

**Consequences:**  
- ✅ Positive outcomes
- ⚠️ Risks or trade-offs
- ❌ Negative outcomes

**Implementation:**  
Key technical details
```

#### 5. Consolidate PROGRESS.md

**New Structure**:
```markdown
# Witch City Rope - Development Progress

## Current Development Status
**Last Updated**: [Date]
**Current Focus**: [Brief description]

### Historical Archive
For complete development history, see:
- [Development History Archive](docs/development/development-history-YYYY-MM.md)

## Current Development Sessions
[Only recent, active sessions]

## Development Standards
[Current architecture, patterns, and practices]

## Next Steps
[Immediate priorities and roadmap]
```

### Content Guidelines

#### What Stays in PROGRESS.md
- **Recency**: Information from last 3-6 months
- **Relevance**: Still applicable to current development
- **Actionability**: Contains next steps or ongoing work
- **Current Architecture**: Reflects current system state

#### What Gets Archived
- **Age**: Older than 6 months
- **Completion**: Fully resolved issues or completed features
- **Obsolescence**: No longer relevant to current system
- **Environmental**: Setup procedures that have changed

#### What Becomes Architecture Documentation
- **Decisions**: Major technology or pattern choices
- **Rationale**: Why we chose specific approaches
- **Consequences**: Long-term impacts of decisions
- **Standards**: Coding patterns and conventions

### Maintenance Checklist

**Before Starting**:
- [ ] Check current PROGRESS.md size
- [ ] Identify logical break points (sessions, dates)
- [ ] Review recent architectural changes

**During Maintenance**:
- [ ] Create historical archive with proper metadata
- [ ] Extract architectural decisions to decisions.md
- [ ] Update PROGRESS.md with current focus only
- [ ] Ensure all content has proper references

**After Maintenance**:
- [ ] Verify all links work correctly
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md if process changed
- [ ] Test that historical content is accessible
- [ ] Document any new patterns discovered

### Tools and Commands

**File Analysis**:
```bash
# Check file size
ls -lh PROGRESS.md

# Word count
wc -w PROGRESS.md

# Find session boundaries
grep -n "## Session" PROGRESS.md

# Find architectural decisions
grep -n -A 2 -B 2 "Decision\|Architecture\|Migration" PROGRESS.md
```

**Content Extraction**:
```bash
# Extract lines between session numbers
sed -n '100,500p' PROGRESS.md > temp_extract.md

# Find all files referencing PROGRESS.md
grep -r "PROGRESS.md" docs/
```

### Integration with Development Workflow

#### New Session Creation
When creating a new development session:
1. Check if PROGRESS.md is approaching size limits
2. If so, schedule maintenance before adding new content
3. Keep session documentation focused and concise

#### Architectural Changes
When making architectural decisions:
1. Document the decision in the session
2. Schedule extraction to decisions.md within 1-2 weeks
3. Use proper ADR format for consistency

#### Historical Reference
When referencing historical work:
1. Link to specific sections in archives
2. Don't duplicate historical content in current sessions
3. Summarize historical context briefly

### Success Metrics

**File Size**: PROGRESS.md should remain under 50KB
**Navigation**: New developers can find current status in < 2 minutes
**Completeness**: No loss of historical information
**Accessibility**: All historical content remains accessible via links

### Example Timeline

**Monthly Schedule**:
- Week 1: Continue normal development
- Week 2: Continue normal development  
- Week 3: Review PROGRESS.md size and relevance
- Week 4: Perform maintenance if needed

**Quarterly Deep Clean**:
- Review all archived content
- Update architecture documentation
- Verify link integrity
- Update this process based on lessons learned

## Process History

### 2025-07-18: Initial Implementation
- **Problem**: PROGRESS.md grew to 109KB (2,388 lines)
- **Solution**: Created this process after manual restructuring
- **Result**: Reduced to ~40KB focused on current development
- **Lesson**: Regular maintenance prevents exponential growth

### Future Updates
Document any changes to this process here with rationale and date.

This process ensures that PROGRESS.md remains a useful tool for current development while preserving the complete historical record in appropriate locations.
