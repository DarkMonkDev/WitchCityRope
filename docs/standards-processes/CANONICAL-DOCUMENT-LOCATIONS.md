# CANONICAL DOCUMENT LOCATIONS - EMERGENCY ENFORCEMENT
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-22 -->

## üö® CRITICAL: DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT CRISIS RESOLVED

**EMERGENCY STATUS**: CATASTROPHIC duplicate file situation discovered and being resolved immediately.

## CANONICAL LOCATIONS - FINAL AUTHORITY

### PROJECT ROOT (/) - PRIMARY DOCUMENTS
**These files MUST exist ONLY at project root - NEVER in /docs/**

| Document | Canonical Location | Purpose | Owner | GitHub Standard |
|----------|-------------------|---------|-------|----------------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | `/CLAUDE.md` | AI assistant configuration | All Agents | ‚úÖ Claude Code |
| **PROGRESS.md** | `/PROGRESS.md` | Current project status | Orchestrator | ‚úÖ Development |
| **README.md** | `/README.md` | Project overview | All | ‚úÖ GitHub Standard |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | `/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System architecture | Architect | ‚úÖ Documentation |
| **SECURITY.md** | `/SECURITY.md` | Security policies | Security Team | ‚úÖ GitHub Standard |
| **ROADMAP.md** | `/ROADMAP.md` | Project roadmap | Product Owner | ‚úÖ Planning |

### DOCS ROOT (/docs/) - ZERO FILES ALLOWED
**üö® CRITICAL: NO FILES ALLOWED IN /docs/ ROOT**

| Status | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|
| **ZERO FILES** | ‚úÖ COMPLIANT |
| **Any file found** | üö® IMMEDIATE VIOLATION |

**ALL PREVIOUS APPROVED FILES ARCHIVED OR MOVED:**
- ‚úÖ **00-START-HERE.md** ‚Üí ARCHIVED to `/docs/_archive/00-start-here-legacy-2025-08-22/`
- ‚úÖ **ARCHITECTURE.md** ‚Üí MOVED to `/ARCHITECTURE.md` (project root)
- ‚úÖ **CLAUDE.md** ‚Üí DELETED (duplicate - canonical in project root)
- ‚úÖ **PROGRESS.md** ‚Üí DELETED (duplicate - canonical in project root)  
- ‚úÖ **QUICK_START.md** ‚Üí MOVED to `/docs/guides-setup/quick-start.md`
- ‚úÖ **ROADMAP.md** ‚Üí MOVED to `/ROADMAP.md` (project root)

## EMERGENCY CONTENT ANALYSIS

### CLAUDE.md Comparison
- **ROOT** `/CLAUDE.md` (240 lines): NEWEST - Contains critical enforcement rules, CURRENT VERSION
- **DOCS** `/docs/CLAUDE.md` (571 lines): OLDER - Legacy content, more verbose, OUTDATED

**DECISION**: Keep ROOT version, archive docs version, merge unique historical content

### PROGRESS.md Comparison
- **ROOT** `/PROGRESS.md` (498 lines): Newer, summary format
- **DOCS** `/docs/PROGRESS.md` (922 lines): Older but MORE DETAILED content

**DECISION**: Merge content - root gets summary, docs content moves to `/docs/architecture/project-history.md`

### Other Files
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Only exists in docs - MOVE to root
- **QUICK_START.md**: Only in docs - MOVE to `/docs/guides-setup/quick-start.md`
- **ROADMAP.md**: Only in docs - MOVE to root

## IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### Phase 1: Content Preservation (URGENT)
1. ‚úÖ Create this canonical locations document
2. üîÑ Compare all duplicate files for unique content
3. üîÑ Create backup archive with timestamps
4. üîÑ Merge unique content without data loss

### Phase 2: Structure Correction (CRITICAL)
1. üîÑ Move `/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` ‚Üí `/ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. üîÑ Move `/docs/QUICK_START.md` ‚Üí `/docs/guides-setup/quick-start.md` 
3. üîÑ Move `/docs/ROADMAP.md` ‚Üí `/ROADMAP.md`
4. üîÑ Archive `/docs/CLAUDE.md` with unique content extracted
5. üîÑ Create `/docs/architecture/project-history.md` from `/docs/PROGRESS.md`
6. üîÑ Delete duplicate files

### Phase 3: Enforcement Implementation (MANDATORY)
1. üîÑ Update docs-structure-validator.sh with canonical locations
2. üîÑ Update all agent training with canonical map
3. üîÑ Add pre-flight checks to CLAUDE.md
4. üîÑ Create post-session validation requirement

### Phase 4: Prevention System (PERMANENT)
1. üîÑ Add canonical location validation to all workflows
2. üîÑ Update file registry with canonical requirements
3. üîÑ Train all agents on NEVER creating root duplicates
4. üîÑ Create automated daily validation

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### How This Happened
1. **Content Migration**: Files were copied during documentation reorganization
2. **Split Content**: Information was divided between locations 
3. **No Cleanup**: Original files left in place after copies made
4. **Enforcement Failure**: Validator didn't catch all violations
5. **Agent Confusion**: Multiple agents creating files in wrong locations

### Prevention Measures
1. **ZERO TOLERANCE**: Any duplicate key file = EMERGENCY
2. **MANDATORY VALIDATION**: Every session must validate canonical locations
3. **AGENT TRAINING**: Update ALL agent guides with this document
4. **AUTOMATED CHECKS**: Structure validator runs automatically
5. **HUMAN REVIEW**: Weekly canonical location audit

## ENFORCEMENT RULES - PERMANENT

### NEVER CREATE
- ‚ùå ANY file in project root except approved list
- ‚ùå ARCHITECTURE.md, CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md, ROADMAP.md in /docs/
- ‚ùå Duplicate configuration or status files
- ‚ùå README.md anywhere except project root

### ALWAYS VALIDATE
- ‚úÖ Check canonical locations BEFORE file operations
- ‚úÖ Use this document as FINAL AUTHORITY
- ‚úÖ Report violations immediately
- ‚úÖ Run structure validator after changes

### VIOLATION RESPONSE
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Stop all work, assess damage
2. **ALERT**: Notify human and librarian agent
3. **PRESERVE**: Backup any unique content
4. **CORRECT**: Move/merge/delete to fix structure
5. **VALIDATE**: Confirm resolution

## SUCCESS METRICS

- **Duplicate Key Files**: 0 (ZERO TOLERANCE)
- **Canonical Location Compliance**: 100%
- **Structure Validator Pass Rate**: 100%
- **Agent Training Completion**: 100%

## HISTORICAL NOTES

**2025-08-22**: EMERGENCY - Discovered 5 duplicate key files in /docs/ root, massive content splits, created this enforcement system to PERMANENTLY prevent recurrence.

**This document is the FINAL AUTHORITY on file locations. Any deviation is a CRITICAL VIOLATION.**
