## 4. Critical Context

### Authentication Patterns to Follow

#### Route Protection Pattern
```typescript
// Copy-paste ready authentication loader
export const authLoader = async (): Promise<User | Response> => {
  const { checkAuth, isAuthenticated, user } = useAuthStore.getState();
  
  if (!isAuthenticated) {
    await checkAuth();
  }
  
  if (!useAuthStore.getState().isAuthenticated) {
    const returnTo = new URL(window.location.href).pathname;
    return redirect(`/login?returnTo=${encodeURIComponent(returnTo)}`);
  }
  
  return useAuthStore.getState().user!;
};
```

#### Role-based Access Pattern
```typescript
// Role-based authorization helper
export const requireRole = (allowedRoles: UserRole[]) => {
  return async (): Promise<User | Response> => {
    const user = await authLoader();
    if (user instanceof Response) return user;
    
    if (!allowedRoles.includes(user.role)) {
      throw new Response('Unauthorized', { status: 403 });
    }
    
    return user;
  };
};

// Usage in router:
{
  path: '/admin/events',
  element: <AdminEventsPage />,
  loader: requireRole(['Admin', 'Teacher'])
}
```

#### API Integration Pattern
```typescript
// TanStack Query mutation with generated types
export const useCreateEvent = () => {
  const queryClient = useQueryClient();
  
  return useMutation({
    mutationFn: async (eventData: CreateEventRequest) => {
      const response = await apiClient.post('/api/events', eventData);
      return response.data.data || response.data; // Handle nested responses
    },
    onSuccess: (newEvent: Event) => {
      // Update event list cache
      queryClient.invalidateQueries(['events']);
      // Show success notification
      notifications.show({
        title: 'Success',
        message: 'Event created successfully',
        color: 'green'
      });
    },
    onError: (error: Error) => {
      // Show error notification with generated error types
      notifications.show({
        title: 'Error',
        message: error.message,
        color: 'red'
      });
    }
  });
};
```

### NSwag Pipeline Usage

#### When Backend APIs Change
1. **Backend Developer**: Updates API endpoints with proper OpenAPI annotations
2. **Type Generation**: Run `npm run generate-types` to update shared-types package
3. **Frontend Integration**: Import updated types from @witchcityrope/shared-types
4. **Testing**: MSW handlers automatically align with generated types
5. **Build Validation**: CI/CD pipeline ensures type consistency

#### Generated Type Import Pattern
```typescript
// ALWAYS import types from generated package:
import { 
  Event, 
  EventRegistration, 
  CreateEventRequest, 
  UpdateEventRequest,
  EventRegistrationStatus 
} from '@witchcityrope/shared-types';

// NEVER manually create DTO interfaces:
// ❌ interface Event { ... } // Manual creation violates architecture
// ✅ import { Event } from '@witchcityrope/shared-types'; // Use generated types
```

### Testing Approach

#### Contract Testing with MSW
```typescript
// MSW handlers aligned with generated types
export const eventHandlers = [
  http.get('/api/events', ({ request }) => {
    return HttpResponse.json({
      success: true,
      data: mockEvents // Mock data using generated Event type
    });
  }),
  
  http.post<CreateEventRequest>('/api/events', async ({ request }) => {
    const eventData = await request.json();
    const newEvent: Event = {
      id: generateId(),
      ...eventData,
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    return HttpResponse.json({ success: true, data: newEvent });
  })
];
```

#### Test Data with Generated Types
```typescript
// Mock data using generated types ensures contract compliance
const mockEvents: Event[] = [
  {
    id: '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000',
    title: 'Intro to Rope Bondage',
    description: 'Learn the basics...',
    startTime: '2025-08-25T19:00:00Z',
    endTime: '2025-08-25T21:00:00Z',
    capacity: 20,
    registeredCount: 15,
    price: 25.00,
    instructorId: 'instructor-uuid',
    status: 'Published'
  }
];
```

### Avoid Manual DTOs

#### ❌ DO NOT:
- Create manual TypeScript interfaces for API data
- Assume API response structure without generated types
- Handle type alignment manually
- Skip type generation when backend changes

#### ✅ ALWAYS DO:
- Import all API types from @witchcityrope/shared-types
- Run `npm run generate-types` when backend APIs change
- Use generated types in MSW handlers for contract testing
- Let NSwag pipeline handle all type alignment
- Reference domain-layer-architecture.md for implementation details

## 5. Quick Start Commands

### Exact Orchestrator Command to Start

```bash
# Start Claude Code:
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
claude-code .

# Recommended command for event management:
/orchestrate "Implement event management system with role-based access. Create public event listing, event details with RSVP, and admin event management using the proven React authentication patterns. Use TanStack Query + Zustand + Mantine v7 + NSwag generated types for all API interactions. Follow the established authentication patterns for protected routes and role-based features."
```

### Alternative Commands by Feature Focus

#### Option 1: Public Event Features First
```bash
/orchestrate "Start with public event features using authentication foundation. Create event listing page and event detail page with RSVP functionality for authenticated users. Use established Mantine v7 components and TanStack Query patterns with NSwag generated Event types."
```

#### Option 2: Complete Event CRUD
```bash
/orchestrate "Implement comprehensive event management with full CRUD operations. Include public event viewing, user RSVP system, and admin event creation/editing. Use role-based access control patterns from authentication system with generated types for all API interactions."
```

#### Option 3: Event Analytics Focus
```bash
/orchestrate "Create event management with analytics dashboard. Include event creation, RSVP tracking, and attendance analytics using the complete authentication system with role-based access. Use established React patterns with generated types."
```

### How to Verify Environment

#### Development Environment Check
```bash
# Verify Docker services running:
docker-compose ps
# Expected: web-service (5651), api-service (5655), postgresql (5433)

# Verify React dev server:
npm run dev
# Expected: Server running on http://localhost:5173

# Verify generated types:
npm run generate-types
# Expected: Types generated successfully in packages/shared-types/

# Verify tests passing:
npm run test
# Expected: All tests passing with 100% success rate
```

#### Authentication System Verification
```bash
# Test authentication endpoints:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5651/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@witchcityrope.com","password":"Test123!"}'
# Expected: Success response with user data

# Test generated types import:
node -e "const { User } = require('./packages/shared-types'); console.log('Types available');"
# Expected: No errors, types imported successfully
```

### Test Credentials That Work

#### Available Test Accounts (All Password: Test123!)
- **Admin**: admin@witchcityrope.com - Full access to all features
- **Teacher**: teacher@witchcityrope.com - Event creation and management
- **Vetted Member**: vetted@witchcityrope.com - Full event access
- **General Member**: member@witchcityrope.com - Basic event access
- **Guest/Attendee**: guest@witchcityrope.com - Limited event viewing

#### Authentication Testing Pattern
```typescript
// Test role-based access in development:
const testRoleAccess = async (email: string, expectedRole: UserRole) => {
  const login = useLogin();
  await login.mutateAsync({ email, password: 'Test123!' });
  const { user } = useAuthStore.getState();
  console.log(`Logged in as ${user?.sceneName} with role ${user?.role}`);
};
```

### Development Workflow Commands

```bash
# Start development environment:
./dev.sh  # Starts all Docker services

# Generate types after backend changes:
npm run generate-types

# Run development server with hot reload:
npm run dev

# Run tests with coverage:
npm run test:coverage

# Run E2E tests (requires Docker services):
npm run test:e2e:playwright

# Build for production (includes type generation):
npm run build

# Health check all services:
curl http://localhost:5651/health  # Web service
curl http://localhost:5655/health  # API service
```
