‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .claude/        (AI agents)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/          (test suites)
```

## How to Continue from React Migration

### 1. Start New Claude Code Session
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
claude-code .
```

### 2. Quick Orientation
- Read main `PROGRESS.md` for current status
- Check `/docs/functional-areas/vertical-slice-home-page/README.md` for next task
- Review `/docs/lessons-learned/LESSONS_LEARNED_SYSTEM.md` for documentation standards

### 3. Execute Vertical Slice with Full Workflow

#### Copy and paste this command:
```
/orchestrate Implement a vertical slice for the home page that displays events. This is a test of the full workflow process. Create a simple GET /api/events endpoint with mock data, a React HomePage component that fetches and displays the events, and an E2E test. Follow all 5 phases with proper sub-agent delegation and enforce quality gates.
```

### 4. Expected Workflow Execution

The orchestrate command will:

**Phase 1: Requirements**
- Analyze existing home page
- Define event data structure
- Create requirements document
- **PAUSE for human review**

**Phase 2: Design**
- ui-designer creates mockups
- Define API specification
- Plan component structure

**Phase 3: Implementation**
- backend-developer creates Events controller
- react-developer creates HomePage component
- **PAUSE for human review**

**Phase 4: Testing**
- test-developer writes tests
- test-executor runs tests
- lint-validator checks code quality (MANDATORY)

**Phase 5: Finalization**
- prettier-formatter formats code (MANDATORY)
- librarian updates documentation
- Capture lessons learned

## Important Reminders for React Migration

### Quality Gates Are Mandatory
- lint-validator MUST run in Phase 4
- prettier-formatter MUST run in Phase 5
- These are NOT optional

### File Registry
- Every file created/modified must be logged
- Check `/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`

### Access Old Project
From the React project, reference Blazor code:
```bash
# Example: View original Events controller
cat ../witchcityrope/src/WitchCityRope.Api/Features/Events/EventsController.cs
```

### Docker Ports
Old project may be using ports 5433, 5653. Either:
- Stop old project: `docker stop witchcity-postgres witchcity-api`
- Or use different ports in docker-compose.yml

## Success Criteria for Vertical Slice

The vertical slice is complete when:
1. Home page displays mock events from API
2. All 5 workflow phases executed
3. All quality gates passed
4. E2E test verifies functionality
5. Lessons learned documented

## Troubleshooting

### If Sub-Agents Don't Work
- Ensure you're in `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react`
- Check `.claude/agents/` directory exists
- Verify agents have correct file extensions (.md)

### If Orchestrate Command Not Found
- Check `.claude/commands/orchestrate.md` exists
- Try restarting Claude Code from project root

### If Tests Fail
- Ensure old project isn't using same ports
- Check npm dependencies installed: `npm install`
- Verify .NET restored: `cd apps/api && dotnet restore`

## Final Notes

The infrastructure is completely ready. The vertical slice will:
- Test the entire workflow process
- Validate all sub-agents work correctly
- Establish patterns for the migration
- Prove the React ‚Üî API communication

Everything is documented and committed. The next session can pick up exactly where we left off using the orchestrate command above.

**Good luck with the vertical slice implementation!**
