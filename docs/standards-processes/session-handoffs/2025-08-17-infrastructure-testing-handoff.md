## Migration Plan Status

### âœ… Phase 0: Technology Research (COMPLETE)
- UI Framework selected and documented
- Forms patterns standardized
- Agent definitions updated
- Documentation consolidated
- Architecture decisions recorded

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1: Infrastructure Testing (NEXT)
**Goal**: Validate technology stack with simple feature implementation

**Testing Priorities**:
1. **Mantine v7 Components**: Test basic component functionality
2. **Form Validation**: Validate Mantine use-form + Zod patterns
3. **UI Theming**: Test branding and design system integration
4. **Authorization**: Verify role-based access integration

**Success Criteria**:
- Simple feature works with Mantine components
- Form validation patterns function correctly
- UI theming applies consistently
- No regressions in existing functionality

### ðŸ“‹ Phase 2: Feature Migration (READY)
- Begin systematic Blazor to React migration
- Apply 5-phase workflow to each feature
- Use technology-researcher for additional decisions
- Scale successful patterns

## Next Session Action Plan

### Immediate Task (Copy/Paste Ready):
```
/orchestrate Test the new Mantine v7 infrastructure by implementing a simple form feature. Use the standardized Mantine use-form + Zod validation patterns documented in the forms guide. Follow the 5-phase workflow to validate technology stack.
```

### Testing Scope:
1. **Simple Form Feature**: Contact form or user profile edit
2. **Mantine Components**: Button, TextInput, Select, validation
3. **Zod Validation**: Schema definition and error handling
4. **UI Integration**: Theming, responsive design, accessibility

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Mantine components render correctly
- [ ] Form validation works with Zod schemas
- [ ] Error messages display properly
- [ ] UI theming applies consistently
- [ ] TypeScript integration functions
- [ ] Accessibility standards maintained
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
