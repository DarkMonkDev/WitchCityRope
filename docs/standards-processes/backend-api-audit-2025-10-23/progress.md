# API Standards & Best Practices Audit - Progress Tracking

**Start Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: In Progress - Research Phase
**Stakeholder**: Chad Bennett

2. **Gap Analysis**: Compare current implementation against best practices
3. **Technical Debt Inventory**: Identify orphaned code, pattern violations, inconsistencies
4. **DTO Audit**: Identify manual DTOs vs auto-generated types
5. **Standards Documentation**: Consolidated coding standards with examples
6. **Recommendations**: Proposed changes with impact analysis

### Success Criteria

- Comprehensive research from Milan Jovanovic (primary source) and Microsoft docs
- Complete gap analysis of `/apps/api/Features/` implementation
- Identification of ALL orphaned/unused files in API project

## Notes and Context

### Important Distinctions
- **This is NOT a migration**: Vertical slice already implemented (August 2025)
- **This is validation**: Confirm implementation follows latest best practices
- **No backward compatibility concerns**: Pre-launch, can change anything
- **All three deliverables are high priority**: Best practices, gap analysis, technical debt

### Research Approach
- **Primary Source**: Milan Jovanovic (Pragmatic Clean Architecture)
- **Critical Thinking**: Question complexity recommendations
- **Simplicity Preference**: Maintain "SIMPLICITY ABOVE ALL" philosophy
- **October 2025 Context**: Latest .NET 9 and EF 9 features available

### Current Implementation Status
- **Location**: `/apps/api/Features/` (modern vertical slice architecture)
- **Reference**: Health feature shows complete pattern implementation
- **Status**: Operational, sub-100ms response times, production-ready
- **Legacy**: All legacy API archived September 2025

### Success Indicators
- Clear actionable findings from research
- Specific file-level gap identification
- Prioritized technical debt inventory
- Consolidated standards ready for immediate use
- Stakeholder-approved recommendations with effort estimates
