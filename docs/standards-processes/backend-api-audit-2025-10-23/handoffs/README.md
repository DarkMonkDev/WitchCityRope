# Handoffs Folder - API Standards Audit October 2025

## Purpose
This folder holds agent handoff documents created during the audit phases to ensure knowledge transfer between agents and sessions.

## Contents
Handoff documents tracking:
- Phase completions (Research → Analysis → Standards → Recommendations)
- Agent transitions (Technology-Researcher → Backend-Developer)
- Session continuations (End of day → Next day startup)
- Quality gate reviews (Human stakeholder approvals)
- Implementation transitions (Audit → Remediation)

## Handoff Document Types

### Phase Completion Handoffs
Created when transitioning between audit phases:
- **Research Complete**: Research findings → Analysis phase
- **Analysis Complete**: Gap analysis → Standards consolidation
- **Standards Complete**: Consolidated standards → Recommendations
- **Recommendations Complete**: Recommendations → Implementation planning

### Agent Transition Handoffs
Created when work moves between different agents:
- **Technology-Researcher → Backend-Developer**: Research findings handoff
- **Backend-Developer → Test-Developer**: Implementation → Testing validation
- **Multiple Agents → Stakeholder**: Quality gate reviews requiring human approval

### Session Continuation Handoffs
Created at end of work sessions:
- Current progress summary
- Work completed in session
- Next steps for continuation
- Known blockers or decisions needed
- References to key documents and files

Use standard handoff template: `/docs/standards-processes/agent-handoff-template.md`

## Naming Convention
- Format: `{agent-name}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{phase}-handoff.md`
