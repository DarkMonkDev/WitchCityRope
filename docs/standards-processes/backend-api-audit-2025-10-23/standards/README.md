# Standards Folder - API Standards Audit October 2025

## Purpose
This folder holds consolidated, definitive backend API coding standards based on research findings and current implementation validation.

## Contents
Comprehensive coding standards documents covering:
- Vertical Slice Architecture implementation patterns
- Service layer conventions and patterns
- Minimal API endpoint standards
- DTO and model design guidelines
- Error handling strategies (consolidated)
- Database query optimization patterns
- Caching implementation guidelines
- Logging standards and levels
- Testing patterns and coverage requirements
- Security best practices
- Performance benchmarks and targets

## Standards Format
Each standard document should include:
1. **Principle Statement**: Core rule/pattern
2. **Justification**: Why this standard exists
3. **Code Examples**:
   - ✅ CORRECT implementation
   - ❌ WRONG anti-patterns
4. **Real-World Example**: From WitchCityRope codebase
5. **Validation Criteria**: How to verify compliance
6. **Exceptions**: When standard doesn't apply

## Documentation Requirements
- Executive summary at top of each standard
- Clear "DO" and "DON'T" sections
- Working code examples that compile
- References to authoritative sources (Milan Jovanovic, Microsoft docs)
- Last reviewed date and version number
- Migration guidance from old patterns to new

## Usage by AI Agents
These standards will be referenced by:
- **Backend-Developer**: Primary implementation guidance
- **Test-Developer**: Testing pattern validation
- **Code Reviewers**: Quality gate enforcement
- **Technology-Researcher**: Standards evolution tracking
