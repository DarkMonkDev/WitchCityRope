# Analysis Folder - API Standards Audit October 2025

## Purpose
This folder holds gap analysis documents comparing current WitchCityRope API implementation against latest best practices research.

## Contents
Analysis documents comparing:
- Current implementation patterns vs. researched best practices
- Code organization and structure consistency
- Error handling standardization gaps
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Testing coverage and patterns
- Documentation completeness
- Security implementation review
- Dependency management assessment

## Analysis Focus Areas

### Pattern Consistency
- Vertical slice implementation consistency across features
- Service layer patterns and conventions
- Endpoint registration standardization
- DTO and model organization

### Technical Debt Identification
- Orphaned code files
- Unused classes and methods
- Duplicate implementations
- Incomplete features
- Deprecated patterns still in use

### Gap Analysis
- Features in research not implemented
- Implementations not following latest patterns
- Missing error handling
- Performance optimization opportunities
- Testing gaps

## Deliverables
Each analysis document should include:
1. **Current State Assessment**: What exists now
2. **Best Practice Reference**: What should exist per research
3. **Gap Identification**: Specific differences
4. **Impact Analysis**: Priority and risk assessment
5. **Recommendations**: Proposed solutions
