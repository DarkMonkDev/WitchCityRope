## Scope of Work - Detailed Recommendations

### PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE WINS (Week 1-2) - 10-12 hours

#### 1.1 Delete Orphaned /Models/ Folder
**Issue:** [From implementation analysis] 888 lines of duplicate code outside Features folder

**Files to Delete:**
```
/apps/api/Models/ApplicationUser.cs              (108 lines)
/apps/api/Models/Event.cs                        (188 lines)
/apps/api/Models/Session.cs                      (78 lines)
/apps/api/Models/TicketPurchase.cs              (97 lines)
/apps/api/Models/TicketType.cs                  (96 lines)
/apps/api/Models/VolunteerPosition.cs           (87 lines)
/apps/api/Models/VolunteerSignup.cs             (107 lines)
/apps/api/Models/ApiResponse.cs                 (14 lines)
/apps/api/Models/Auth/*                         (4 files, 113 lines)
```

**Verification Required:**
1. Confirm Features/* versions are complete and identical
2. Search codebase for any imports of /Models/* files
3. Update imports to point to Features/* locations
4. Delete entire /Models/ folder
5. Rebuild and test

**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH
- Eliminates import confusion
- Prevents compilation ambiguity
- Reduces maintenance surface

**Risk:** LOW - All files have duplicates in Features/
**Breaking Change:** NO - Internal refactor only

---

#### 1.2 Standardize Folder Naming Conventions
**Issue:** [From implementation analysis] Inconsistent folder naming across 6 features

**Changes Required:**

| Feature | Current | Target | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| CheckIn | Entities/Configuration/ | Configuration/ | Move out of Entities/ |
| Cms | Configurations/ | Configuration/ | Rename (singular) |
| Vetting | Entities/Configuration/ | Configuration/ | Move out of Entities/ |
| Participation | Data/ | Configuration/ | Rename folder |
| Payments | Data/ | Configuration/ | Rename folder |
| Safety | Validation/ + Validators/ | Validators/ | Consolidate, delete Validation/ |

**Standard Naming:**
- `Configuration/` (singular, feature root)
- `Validators/` (plural, FluentValidation convention)
- `Endpoints/`, `Models/`, `Services/` (all plural)

**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM
- Improves pattern consistency (82% → 100%)
- Easier navigation for developers
- Clearer file organization

**Risk:** LOW - Namespace updates only
**Breaking Change:** NO - Internal refactor

---

#### 1.3 Cleanup /Services/ Folder (Partial)
**Issue:** [From implementation analysis] Orphaned auth services duplicating Features/Authentication/

**Files to Delete:**
```
/apps/api/Services/AuthService.cs         # Duplicate of Features/Authentication/Services/
/apps/api/Services/IAuthService.cs        # Duplicate interface
```

**Files to KEEP (Shared Infrastructure):**
```
/apps/api/Services/JwtService.cs
/apps/api/Services/IJwtService.cs
/apps/api/Services/TokenBlacklistService.cs
/apps/api/Services/ITokenBlacklistService.cs
/apps/api/Services/DatabaseInitializationService.cs
/apps/api/Services/SeedDataService.cs
```

**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Impact:** 🟢 LOW-MEDIUM
- Reduces duplication
- Clarifies service ownership

**Risk:** LOW - Duplicates exist in Features/
**Breaking Change:** NO

---

### PHASE 2: PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION (Week 3-4) - 12-16 hours

#### 2.1 AsNoTracking() Coverage Expansion
**Issue:** [From analysis] 75 current usages, need ~95 for complete coverage

**Missing Coverage (Estimated 15-20 queries):**
- Some read-only endpoints in Cms feature
- Dashboard feature queries
- Metadata feature queries
- Report generation queries

**Pattern to Apply:**
```csharp
// BEFORE
var events = await _context.Events
    .Where(e => e.IsPublished)
    .ToListAsync();

// AFTER
var events = await _context.Events
    .AsNoTracking()  // ADD THIS
    .Where(e => e.IsPublished)
    .ToListAsync();
```

**Verification:**
1. Grep for all `.ToListAsync()`, `.FirstOrDefaultAsync()`, etc. in Features/
2. Check if query has AsNoTracking()
3. Verify query is read-only (no SaveChangesAsync() after)
4. Add AsNoTracking() if missing

**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH
- 20-40% faster read queries
- 40% reduced memory usage
- Better scalability

**Risk:** VERY LOW - Safe optimization
**Breaking Change:** NO
**Performance Gain:** PROVEN - 20-40% improvement

---

#### 2.2 Results.Problem() Standardization
**Issue:** [From analysis] 66 current usages, need ~130 for consistent error handling

**Missing Coverage:**
- ~64 endpoints still using custom error responses
- Inconsistent error format for frontend
- Missing RFC 7807 compliance

**Pattern to Apply:**
```csharp
// BEFORE
if (!success)
{
    return Results.BadRequest(new { error = message });
}

// AFTER
if (!success)
{
    return Results.Problem(
        title: "Operation Failed",
        detail: message,
        statusCode: 400
    );
}
```

**Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM
- Consistent API error responses
- Better frontend error handling
- RFC 7807 compliance

**Risk:** LOW - Response format change
**Breaking Change:** MINOR - Frontend may need error handling updates

---

#### 2.3 Expand OpenAPI Metadata
**Issue:** [From DTO audit] Some endpoints missing .WithSummary(), .WithDescription()

**Enhancement:**
```csharp
// Currently: Good but can be better
app.MapGet("/api/users/{id}", handler)
    .Produces<UserDto>(200)
    .Produces<ProblemDetails>(404);

// Enhanced: Add summaries and descriptions
app.MapGet("/api/users/{id}", handler)
    .WithName("GetUserById")
    .WithSummary("Retrieve user by ID")
    .WithDescription("Returns detailed user profile including roles, contact info, and vetting status")
    .WithTags("Users")
    .Produces<UserDto>(200, "application/json")
    .Produces<ProblemDetails>(404)
    .Produces<ProblemDetails>(500);
```

**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Impact:** 🟢 LOW-MEDIUM
- Better Swagger documentation
- Improved developer experience
- Clearer API contracts

**Risk:** NONE
**Breaking Change:** NO

---

### PHASE 3: DTO ALIGNMENT (Week 5-6) - 16-20 hours

#### 3.1 Replace Core API Types
**Issue:** [From DTO audit Priority 1] /types/api.types.ts with manual definitions

**Changes:**
```typescript
// BEFORE: Manual definitions
export interface UserDto {
  id?: string;
  // ... manual fields
}

// AFTER: Generated imports
import type { components } from '@witchcityrope/shared-types';
export type UserDto = components['schemas']['UserDto'];
export type EventDto = components['schemas']['EventDto'];
```

**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH
- Eliminates type drift risk
- Automatic updates on API changes
- Compile-time type safety

**Risk:** LOW - Verify generated types match
**Breaking Change:** NO (if types match)

---

#### 3.2 Add Missing Backend OpenAPI Metadata
**Issue:** [From DTO audit] 6-8 endpoints missing .Produces<T>() annotations

**Endpoints to Update:**
- GET /api/vetting/status → Add .Produces<VettingStatusResponse>()
- GET /api/vetting/application-status → Add .Produces<ApplicationStatusInfo>()
- Safety endpoints → Verify .Produces<SafetyIncidentDto>()
- Email template endpoints → Add .Produces<EmailTemplateDto>()

**Effort:** 1-2 hours
**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM
- Enables type generation for missing types
- Better OpenAPI documentation

**Risk:** NONE
**Breaking Change:** NO

---

#### 3.3 Regenerate Shared-Types Package
**Action:** Run NSwag type generation after backend metadata additions

```bash
cd packages/shared-types
npm run generate
```

**Effort:** 15 minutes
**Impact:** Required for DTO alignment

---

#### 3.4 Replace Safety Feature Types
**Issue:** [From DTO audit Priority 2] 80+ lines of manual safety types

**Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH - Active feature development
**Risk:** LOW
**Breaking Change:** NO

---

#### 3.5 Replace Dashboard, Vetting, Other Feature Types
**Issue:** [From DTO audit Priorities 3-5] 10+ files with manual types

**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Impact:** 🟡 MEDIUM - Distributed across features
**Risk:** LOW
**Breaking Change:** NO

---

#### 3.6 Add ESLint Rule (Enforcement)
**Action:** Create ESLint rule to prevent future manual DTO creation

**Rule Pattern:**
```javascript
// Forbid manual DTO interface definitions
{
  "no-restricted-syntax": [
    "error",
    {
      "selector": "TSInterfaceDeclaration[id.name=/.*Dto$/]",
      "message": "Manual DTO interfaces forbidden. Use @witchcityrope/shared-types generated types."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Effort:** 2 hours
**Impact:** 🔴 HIGH - Prevents future violations
**Risk:** NONE
**Breaking Change:** NO

---

### PHASE 4: ADVANCED OPTIMIZATION (Month 2+) - 10-14 hours

#### 4.1 Profile and Add Compiled Queries (Selective)
**Issue:** [From research] Compiled queries can provide 5-15% improvement on hot paths

**Approach:**
1. Profile application under load
2. Identify top 10 highest-frequency queries
3. Implement compiled queries for proven hot paths only
4. Measure actual performance improvement

**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Impact:** 🟢 LOW-MEDIUM - Selective optimization
**Risk:** LOW
**Breaking Change:** NO

---

#### 4.2 Implement Caching Layer (Future)
**Issue:** [From analysis] No caching currently implemented

**Recommendation:** Add selective caching for static data only

**Candidates:**
- Role list (changes infrequently)
- System settings
- Reference data

**NOT Candidates:**
- User data
- Event registrations
- Real-time data

**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Impact:** 🟢 LOW - Benefits limited to specific scenarios
**Risk:** MEDIUM - Cache invalidation complexity
**Breaking Change:** NO
