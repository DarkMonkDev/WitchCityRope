# CLAUDE.md Update Summary
<!-- Date: 2025-08-04 -->
<!-- Purpose: Document changes made to CLAUDE.md to reference new documentation structure -->

## Overview
This document summarizes the updates made to CLAUDE.md to eliminate duplicate content and properly reference the new documentation structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added New Documentation Structure Section
Added a prominent section after the Docker warning that directs all new workers and AI agents to:
- Start with `/docs/00-START-HERE.md` for navigation
- Review `PROGRESS.md` for current project status
- Check `/docs/functional-areas/` for feature documentation
- Follow `/docs/standards-processes/` for standards

### 2. Removed Duplicate Content
The following duplicate content was removed from CLAUDE.md:
- Project status information (now in PROGRESS.md)
- Test status and results (now in TEST_CATALOG.md)
- Detailed session history (now in PROGRESS.md)
- Recent work completed sections

### 3. Updated References
Updated all documentation references to point to the new structure:
- Changed coding standards reference to `/docs/standards-processes/`
- Updated documentation file references to new locations
- Added links to key documentation files

### 4. Simplified Quick Start Guide
Reorganized the Essential First Steps to:
1. Direct to documentation navigation first
2. Reference PROGRESS.md for status
3. Point to proper documentation locations
4. Maintain only Claude-specific configuration

## Key Principle Applied
**Single Source of Truth**: CLAUDE.md now contains ONLY Claude-specific configuration and warnings, with all other information properly referenced in the new documentation structure.

## Result
CLAUDE.md is now:
- More concise (removed ~150 lines of duplicate content)
- Properly references the new documentation structure
- Directs new workers to review documentation first
- Maintains only Claude-specific critical warnings

## Verification
New workers and AI agents will now:
1. See the documentation structure warning immediately
2. Be directed to proper documentation locations
3. Not encounter conflicting or duplicate information
4. Have clear paths to find any information they need
