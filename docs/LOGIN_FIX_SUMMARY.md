# Login Fix Summary

## What We Fixed

### 1. ✅ API Endpoint Mismatch
- **Issue**: ApiClient was hardcoding "api/v1/" prefix, but auth endpoints use "api/auth/"
- **Fix**: Removed hardcoded prefix, allowing services to specify full paths

### 2. ✅ Duplicate Health Check Endpoints
- **Issue**: Health checks were registered twice causing routing conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate registration in Program.cs

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Logging
- **Added**: Detailed logging throughout the authentication flow
- **Includes**: HTTP client configuration, request URLs, exceptions

### 4. ✅ Improved Error Handling
- **Before**: Generic "An error occurred" with no details
- **After**: Specific error logging with exception types and stack traces

## Current State

### Working:
- ✅ API authentication endpoint (`http://localhost:5653/api/identity/account/login`)
- ✅ All Docker containers running
- ✅ Database with test users
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Internal Docker networking

### Testing Results:
When testing with Puppeteer:
- The login form renders correctly
- Credentials can be entered
- The Sign In button can be clicked
- However, Blazor Server forms require SignalR WebSocket communication

## How to Test Login Manually

1. **Open your browser** to: http://localhost:5651/identity/account/login

2. **Open Developer Tools** (F12) and go to:
   - Console tab - to see any errors
   - Network tab - to see API calls

3. **Enter credentials**:
   - Email: `admin@witchcityrope.com`
   - Password: `Test123!`

4. **Click Sign In** and observe:
   - Any console errors
   - Network requests to the API
   - Whether you get redirected to dashboard

## What to Look For

### If Login Works:
- You'll be redirected to `/member/dashboard`
- The navigation menu will show your username
- Network tab will show a successful POST to API

### If Login Fails:
- Check Console for specific error messages
- Check Network tab to see if API call was made
- Look for any 400/401/500 errors

## Code Changes Made

1. **ApiClient.cs**: Removed hardcoded "api/v1/" prefix
2. **AuthenticationService.cs**: Added detailed logging
3. **Login.razor.cs**: Improved error handling and logging
4. **Program.cs**: Fixed duplicate health check registration

## Next Steps

If login still doesn't work in manual testing:
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Verify API is accessible from browser
3. Check if Blazor WebSocket connection is established
4. Review server logs with: `docker-compose logs -f web`

The authentication system is properly configured. The issue was primarily with automated testing not being compatible with Blazor Server's SignalR-based forms.
