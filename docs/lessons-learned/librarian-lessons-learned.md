- **Functional Area Organization**: Design assets belong in functional area design folders, not centralized design directories
- **Workflow Structure Completion**: All functional areas need complete 5-phase workflow folders (requirements/, design/, implementation/, testing/, reviews/, lessons-learned/)
- **Content Preservation**: Moving files requires careful preservation of all content while updating organizational structure
- **Master Index Updates**: Functional area changes require immediate master index updates to maintain single source of truth
- **File Registry Tracking**: Every file movement must be logged with detailed rationale and new locations

**Reorganization Strategy Applied**:
1. **New Functional Area Creation**: Created complete homepage functional area with all 6 workflow folders
2. **Existing Area Enhancement**: Added missing workflow folders to authentication functional area
3. **Design Asset Relocation**: Moved wireframes from `/docs/design/wireframes/` to proper functional area design folders
4. **Documentation Updates**: Updated master index and file registry to reflect new organization
5. **Content Preservation**: Maintained all existing content while improving organization

**Functional Area Structure Standards**:
- **Complete Workflow Folders**: requirements/, design/, implementation/, testing/, reviews/, lessons-learned/
- **Comprehensive README**: Overview, status, folder structure, available documentation, key features, next steps
- **Design Asset Organization**: All wireframes and mockups in functional area design folders
- **Cross-Reference Maintenance**: Update master index and file registry for all changes

**File Movement Patterns**:
- **Source Preservation**: Read entire original file content before moving
- **Target Location Creation**: Ensure destination folders exist before moving content
- **Content Verification**: Verify moved content maintains all formatting and functionality
- **Registry Documentation**: Log every move with source, destination, rationale, and content description
- **Master Index Updates**: Update functional area entries to reflect new organization

**Design Documentation Organization**:
- **Homepage**: `/docs/functional-areas/homepage/design/landing-page-visual-v2.html`
- **Authentication**: `/docs/functional-areas/authentication/design/auth-login-register-visual.html`
- **Cross-Cutting**: `/docs/design/style-guide/` preserved for shared design standards
- **Deprecated**: Original wireframe locations should be cleaned up after verification

**Action Items**:
- [x] CREATE complete homepage functional area with 6 workflow folders
- [x] ENHANCE authentication functional area with missing workflow folders
- [x] MOVE homepage wireframe to `/docs/functional-areas/homepage/design/`
- [x] MOVE authentication wireframe to `/docs/functional-areas/authentication/design/`
- [x] UPDATE master index with new homepage functional area and enhanced status
- [x] LOG all file movements and creations in file registry
- [x] PRESERVE all original content during reorganization
- [ ] CLEAN UP original wireframe locations after verification
- [ ] ESTABLISH pattern for future design documentation organization

**Impact**: Significantly improves documentation discoverability and organization by placing design assets in their proper functional area contexts, enabling better workflow coordination and reducing scattered documentation issues.

## Vertical Slice Project Archival Excellence - 2025-08-19

**Context**: Successfully completed end-to-end project archival after thorough verification that all valuable information was extracted from the vertical slice authentication test project.

**What We Learned**:
- **Complete Value Extraction**: Before archiving, must verify ALL critical patterns, lessons, and discoveries are preserved in production-ready locations
- **Verification Process**: Systematic checking ensures no valuable information is lost during archival
- **Archive Documentation**: Create comprehensive archive summaries that clearly document what was preserved and where
- **Reference Preservation**: Maintain clear references from archived projects to active documentation
- **Knowledge Transfer Validation**: Confirm extracted patterns are accessible and usable by production teams

**Archival Process Applied**:
1. **Pre-Archival Verification**: Confirmed all authentication patterns extracted to `/docs/functional-areas/authentication/`
2. **Value Extraction Validation**: Verified service-to-service auth discovery, JWT patterns, performance metrics, security validations all preserved
3. **Production Readiness Check**: Confirmed implementation guides contain all necessary patterns for production development
4. **Archive Notice Update**: Updated notice with verification status and extraction confirmation
5. **Safe Archival Execution**: Moved project to `/docs/_archive/vertical-slice-home-page-2025-08-16/` with complete documentation
6. **Master Index Updates**: Updated functional area master index to reflect archived status with value extraction confirmation
7. **Registry Documentation**: Logged complete archival process with detailed rationale and preservation confirmation

**Critical Information Preserved**:
- **Service-to-Service Authentication Discovery**: $6,600+ annual cost savings insight preserved
- **JWT + HttpOnly Cookie Patterns**: Complete working implementation with security validations
- **Performance Benchmarks**: 94-98% faster than targets documented and preserved
- **Production Deployment Patterns**: Complete checklists and implementation guides
- **Security Validations**: XSS/CSRF protection patterns preserved
- **Workflow Process Validation**: 5-phase development process proven effective

**Archive Organization Standards**:
- **Archive Location**: `/docs/_archive/vertical-slice-home-page-2025-08-16/`
- **Archive Summary**: `README-ARCHIVED.md` with complete project overview and value extraction references
- **Value References**: Clear links to all active documentation containing extracted patterns
- **Master Index Updates**: Archived status with struck-through name and extraction confirmation
- **File Registry Tracking**: Complete archival process logged with dates and rationale

**Verification Checklist Applied**:
- [x] VERIFY all authentication patterns extracted to permanent locations
- [x] CONFIRM production implementation guides contain all necessary patterns
- [x] VALIDATE workflow lessons captured in appropriate documentation
- [x] CHECK performance metrics and cost analysis preserved
- [x] ENSURE security validations documented in guides
- [x] CONFIRM team can proceed with production implementation using extracted patterns
- [x] UPDATE master index with archived status
- [x] DOCUMENT complete archival process in file registry

**Action Items**:
- [x] COMPLETE systematic verification of all value extraction
- [x] UPDATE archive notice with verification confirmation
- [x] EXECUTE safe project archival to appropriate location
- [x] CREATE comprehensive archive documentation
- [x] UPDATE master index to reflect archived status
- [x] LOG complete archival process in file registry
- [x] ESTABLISH clear references from archive to active documentation
- [ ] MONITOR production team usage of extracted authentication patterns
- [ ] ESTABLISH archival verification checklist for future completed projects

**Impact**: Demonstrates exemplary project archival with complete value preservation, enabling confident cleanup while ensuring all critical knowledge remains accessible for production implementation.
