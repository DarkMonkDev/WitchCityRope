## Template Usage Instructions

### When to Use This Template
- Copy this template when creating a new domain-specific lessons learned file
- Replace `[Domain]` with the specific domain (e.g., "Backend", "Frontend", "Testing")
- Delete these instructions after copying

### Domain Examples
- Backend Lessons Learned
- Frontend Lessons Learned
- Testing Lessons Learned
- Database Lessons Learned
- DevOps Lessons Learned
- Security Lessons Learned
- Performance Lessons Learned
- Integration Lessons Learned
- UI/UX Lessons Learned
- Architecture Lessons Learned

### Writing Guidelines
1. **Be Specific**: Avoid vague statements; provide concrete details
2. **Be Actionable**: Every lesson should result in specific action items
3. **Provide Context**: Future readers should understand the situation without additional research
4. **Use Consistent Dating**: Always use YYYY-MM-DD format
5. **Tag Appropriately**: Use standardized tags for discoverability
6. **Link Extensively**: Connect to related documentation and resources

### Common Tags to Use
- `#critical` - Critical issues that caused significant problems
- `#process` - Process improvements and workflow changes
- `#tooling` - Tool selection and configuration lessons
- `#debugging` - Debugging techniques and troubleshooting
