## How to Use These Files

1. **Starting Work**: Read your role's file before beginning any task
2. **Hit a Problem**: Check if it's already documented with a solution
3. **Learned Something**: Add it to your role's file immediately
4. **Monthly Review**: Remove outdated lessons, update existing ones

## Contributing Guidelines

### Adding New Lessons
```markdown
### Brief Problem Description
**Issue**: What went wrong or was confusing  
**Solution**: How to fix or avoid it
```example code or commands```
**Applies to**: When this lesson is relevant
```

### Format Requirements
- Keep examples concise but complete
- Include "Applies to" for context
- Add code examples where helpful
- Mark deprecated approaches clearly

### What Makes a Good Lesson
‚úÖ **Good**: "SignInManager fails in Blazor components with 'Headers are read-only' error"
‚ùå **Bad**: "Authentication doesn't work"

‚úÖ **Good**: Specific solution with code example
‚ùå **Bad**: "Just restart everything"

## Review Process

**Monthly Review** (First Monday of each month):
1. Each role owner reviews their file
2. Remove lessons no longer applicable
3. Update examples to current patterns
4. Add new discoveries from past month

**Criteria for Removal**:
- Technology no longer used (e.g., MudBlazor)
- Pattern replaced by better approach
- Issue fixed in framework update
- No longer relevant to project

## Cross-Role Lessons

Some lessons apply to multiple roles. These should be:
1. Added to each relevant role file
2. Kept in sync during reviews
3. Tagged with "See also: [other-role].md"

## Historical Lessons

When removing lessons, consider if they have historical value:
- Major architectural decisions
- Significant debugging victories
- Patterns that might return

These can be moved to `history/` subfolder with date prefix.

## Questions or Suggestions?

- Can't find what you need? Ask in team chat
