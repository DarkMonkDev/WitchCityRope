# STRICT RULES FOR LESSONS LEARNED FILES

## PURPOSE
Lessons learned files contain ONLY prevention patterns and mistakes to avoid. They are NOT progress reports, project history, or celebration documents.

## ONLY ALLOWED CONTENT:

‚úÖ **Prevention patterns** (what to avoid and why)
‚úÖ **Common mistakes** and their solutions  
‚úÖ **Brief "Problem/Solution" pairs** (max 2 sentences each)
‚úÖ **Code snippets** showing wrong vs right (NO LINE LIMIT for valuable examples)
‚úÖ **Error patterns** and how to prevent them

## VALUABLE PATTERNS TO KEEP (NOT REMOVE):

üîß **"Pattern for Future Development"** sections WITH FULL CODE
üîß **Complete working code examples** that show correct implementation
üîß **Architecture decision patterns** with rationales
üîß **Migration strategies** that prevent issues
üîß **Configuration requirements** and examples
üîß **Testing patterns** that avoid common failures
üîß **Performance optimization** patterns
üîß **Security patterns** and requirements
üîß **Integration patterns** between systems
üîß **Common pitfall warnings** with solutions
üîß **Root cause analyses** that prevent recurrence
üîß **Critical warnings** about system behavior
üîß **API usage patterns** that prevent errors
üîß **Deployment patterns** that avoid failures
üîß **Debugging strategies** for common issues

These patterns are LESSONS LEARNED - they teach future sessions how to avoid problems!

## ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN IN LESSONS LEARNED:

‚ùå **Status reports** or progress updates
‚ùå **"Successfully completed" entries**
‚ùå **Project history** or timelines
‚ùå **Celebration or achievement entries**
‚ùå **Task completion summaries**
‚ùå **"MAJOR SUCCESS" declarations**
‚ùå **Results summaries**
‚ùå **Context sections with project details**
‚ùå **Business impact sections**

## VALUABLE CONTENT THAT BELONGS ELSEWHERE:

üìö **Implementation guides** ‚Üí `/docs/guides-setup/` or `/docs/functional-areas/[area]/implementation/`
üìö **Code examples** (>3 lines) ‚Üí `/docs/functional-areas/[area]/code-examples/`
üìö **Integration strategies** ‚Üí `/docs/architecture/` or `/docs/functional-areas/[area]/architecture/`
üìö **Detailed workflows** ‚Üí `/docs/standards-processes/` or `/docs/functional-areas/[area]/workflows/`
üìö **API documentation** ‚Üí `/docs/functional-areas/[area]/api/`
üìö **Testing strategies** ‚Üí `/docs/functional-areas/testing/strategies/`

## CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLES:

### ‚úÖ RIGHT:
```markdown
**Problem**: Creating files in /docs/ root breaks navigation.
**Solution**: Always use functional area subdirectories.
```

```markdown
**Problem**: Agents add status reports to lessons learned.
**Solution**: Use /session-work/ for progress, lessons for mistakes only.
```

### ‚ùå WRONG:
```markdown
## MAJOR SUCCESS: File Consolidation Complete (2025-08-23)

**ACHIEVEMENT**: Successfully cleaned up and consolidated all duplicate files...
```

```markdown
**FILES CONSOLIDATED**:
- ‚úÖ React Developer: Merged files successfully
- ‚úÖ Backend Developer: Preserved 1,430 lines
**RESULTS**: Zero duplicate files, no information loss...
```

## CRITICAL: CODE EXAMPLES ARE LESSONS LEARNED

**NEVER REMOVE:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT code examples (these show what works!)
- ‚ùå WRONG code examples (these show what to avoid!)
- Complete endpoint implementations
- Full configuration examples
- Multi-line code patterns that work
- JWT/authentication examples
- Error handling patterns
- Service layer implementations

**Code examples ARE the lesson** - they're not "implementation details" to remove!

## FORMAT GUIDELINES

- Any lessons learned entry that includes pure status reports should be removed
- Keep ALL technical patterns and code examples
- Focus on preserving knowledge over reducing file size
- Organize by topic for easy scanning

## ENFORCEMENT PROCESS:

1. **Detection**: Automated validation checks for forbidden content
2. **Rejection**: Non-compliant entries rejected immediately  
3. **Rewrite Required**: Agent must rewrite in proper format
4. **Template Reference**: Use LESSONS-LEARNED-TEMPLATE.md for structure
5. **No Exceptions**: Rules apply to ALL agents and ALL lessons learned files

## WHY THIS MATTERS:

- **Agents need prevention patterns**, not project history
- **Lessons learned ‚â† Progress reports** - they serve different purposes
- **Quick reference required** - agents scan for specific patterns
- **Prevent file bloat** - keep focused on actionable knowledge
- **Clear boundaries** - prevents confusion about file purpose

## IMPORTANT: PRESERVE VALUABLE CONTENT

When cleaning up lessons learned files:
1. **DON'T DELETE** implementation guides - move them to appropriate locations
2. **DON'T DELETE** useful code examples - move to code-examples folders
3. **DON'T DELETE** architectural decisions - move to architecture docs
4. **CREATE NEW FILES** for valuable content that doesn't fit lessons learned format
5. **UPDATE FILE REGISTRY** when moving content to new locations

Remember: If it's not a mistake or prevention pattern, it doesn't belong in lessons learned - but it may still be valuable documentation that belongs elsewhere!
