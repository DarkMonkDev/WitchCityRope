# CRITICAL ORCHESTRATION FAILURE: Test-Fix-Coordinator Handoff Not Executing

## Problem Identified (2025-08-13)
**SEVERITY: CRITICAL - User reported 4+ times**

### What's Happening
When orchestrator is invoked for testing/debugging/fixing tasks, it CLAIMS to delegate to test-fix-coordinator but doesn't actually invoke it via Task tool.

### Root Cause
The orchestrator agent is returning a response saying "I've delegated to test-fix-coordinator" WITHOUT actually using the Task tool to invoke it. This is a CRITICAL violation of the orchestration protocol.

### The WRONG Pattern (What's happening now)
```
User: "continue testing"
Main Assistant: [Invokes orchestrator]
Orchestrator: "I've delegated to test-fix-coordinator" [BUT DOESN'T ACTUALLY DO IT]
Main Assistant: "The orchestrator has delegated..." [STOPS - nothing happens]
```

### The CORRECT Pattern (What MUST happen)
```
User: "continue testing"
Main Assistant: [Invokes orchestrator]
Orchestrator: [IMMEDIATELY invokes Task tool with test-fix-coordinator]
Test-Fix-Coordinator: [Starts running tests immediately]
```

## CRITICAL FIX REQUIRED

### For Orchestrator Agent
When you receive ANY testing/debugging/fixing request, you MUST:
1. IMMEDIATELY use the Task tool to invoke test-fix-coordinator
2. NOT just say you're delegating - ACTUALLY DO IT
3. The Task invocation MUST include:
   - subagent_type: "test-fix-coordinator"
   - description: Brief description
   - prompt: Full context and requirements

### Example of CORRECT Implementation
```
Task tool invocation:
{
  "subagent_type": "test-fix-coordinator",
  "description": "Continue testing phase",
  "prompt": "Continue the testing, debugging, and fixing phase. [full context]"
}
```

## Verification Steps
1. Orchestrator MUST show actual Task tool use in its response
2. Test-fix-coordinator MUST start executing immediately
3. NO pause or human review between handoff
4. NO "delegation successful" messages without actual Task invocation

## User Impact
- User has reported this 4+ times
- Creates workflow interruption
- Breaks automation promise
- Causes justified frustration

## PERMANENT FIX
This must be added to orchestrator.md startup instructions:
"When delegating to test-fix-coordinator, you MUST use the Task tool IMMEDIATELY. Do not just say you're delegating - ACTUALLY INVOKE THE TASK TOOL."

## ADDITIONAL ISSUE DISCOVERED
The test-fix-coordinator claims it doesn't have the Task tool even though its configuration clearly states it does (line 4: tools: TodoWrite, Task, Bash).
This is preventing it from delegating fixes to other agents.

### Fix Required for test-fix-coordinator.md
Add explicit reminder in the agent definition:
"YOU HAVE THE TASK TOOL - USE IT TO DELEGATE ALL FIXES TO OTHER AGENTS"
