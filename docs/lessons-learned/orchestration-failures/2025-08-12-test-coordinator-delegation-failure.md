# Orchestrator Test-Fix-Coordinator Delegation Failure

## Date: 2025-08-12

## Problem
The orchestrator repeatedly failed to delegate testing work to the test-fix-coordinator agent, instead attempting to:
1. Run tests directly using `dotnet test` or `npm test`
2. Fix code issues itself
3. Bypass the established test/fix delegation pattern

This violates the core orchestration principle of delegation-only operation.

## Root Cause
1. **Primary Issue**: The test-fix-coordinator had Read, Grep, and Glob tools in its tool list, enabling it to read and search code directly instead of just running tests and delegating fixes.
2. **Secondary Issue**: The orchestrator.md file lacked sufficiently explicit and prominent warnings about test delegation. The instructions were buried in Phase 4 without clear violation detection mechanisms.

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Even with perfect delegation instructions, if an agent has tools that allow direct implementation, it WILL use them instead of delegating.

## Solution Applied

### 1. REMOVED TOOLS FROM TEST-FIX-COORDINATOR
**MOST CRITICAL FIX**: Changed test-fix-coordinator tools from:
- `tools: TodoWrite, Task, Read, Bash, Grep, Glob`
To:
- `tools: TodoWrite, Task, Bash`

This physically prevents the coordinator from reading or modifying code.

### 2. Added Tool Restriction Enforcement Section
Added explicit list of tools the coordinator DOES NOT HAVE to make it clear it cannot read/edit code.

### 3. Updated Orchestrator with Violation Detection
Added a prominent warning section in Phase 4 that explicitly lists forbidden commands and marks them as violations.

### 4. Added Top-Level Test Delegation Rule
Added a critical rule immediately after invocation triggers that catches testing-related requests early in the process.

### 5. Provided Explicit Delegation Pattern
Added a complete, copy-paste ready delegation pattern for test-fix-coordinator invocation.

## Key Changes to orchestrator.md

```markdown
## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL TEST DELEGATION RULE ðŸš¨
**When user mentions "testing", "debugging", or "fixing":**
1. You MUST immediately delegate to `test-fix-coordinator`
2. You MUST NOT run any `dotnet test` or `npm test` commands yourself
3. You MUST NOT attempt to fix any code yourself
4. VIOLATION = ORCHESTRATION FAILURE
```

## Prevention Measures

1. **Early Detection**: Added test delegation rule at the TOP of orchestrator.md, right after invocation triggers
2. **Explicit Violations**: Listed specific commands that constitute violations
3. **Clear Pattern**: Provided exact Task tool invocation pattern to use
4. **Visual Warnings**: Used emoji indicators (ðŸš¨) to make critical sections stand out

## Testing the Fix

To verify this fix works:
1. Invoke orchestrator with "continue testing" request
2. Verify it immediately delegates to test-fix-coordinator
3. Verify it does NOT run any test commands itself
4. Verify test-fix-coordinator manages the entire cycle

## Long-term Improvements Needed

1. **Automated Validation**: Create a validation script that checks agent definitions for proper delegation patterns
2. **Agent Training**: Ensure all agents read their lessons-learned on startup
3. **Monitoring**: Track delegation failures and create alerts
4. **Documentation**: Add this pattern to agent creation guidelines

## Impact
This failure pattern has occurred multiple times, causing frustration and wasted time. The fix should prevent future occurrences by making the delegation requirement impossible to miss.
