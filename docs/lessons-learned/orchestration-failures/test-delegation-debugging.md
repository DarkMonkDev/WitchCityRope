# Test Delegation Debugging Log

## Problem Analysis
User reports orchestrator runs tests directly instead of delegating to test-fix-coordinator (7+ times).

## What Main Assistant Passes to Orchestrator

### Actual Invocation (from session 2025-08-13):
```python
Task(
    description="Continue user management testing",
    subagent_type="orchestrator", 
    prompt="Continue the testing, debugging and fixing phase of the user management project..."
)
```

### Keywords Present in Prompt:
- ✅ "testing" - PRESENT
- ✅ "debugging" - PRESENT  
- ✅ "fixing" - PRESENT
- ✅ "Continue" - PRESENT

## Conclusion
**The main assistant IS passing the correct keywords to the orchestrator.**

The problem is NOT with what's being passed, but with the orchestrator ignoring its own rules.

## Orchestrator's Instructions (lines 21-32)
```
CRITICAL TEST DELEGATION RULE
When user mentions "testing", "debugging", or "fixing":
1. You MUST immediately delegate to test-fix-coordinator
2. You MUST NOT run any dotnet test or npm test commands yourself
3. You MUST NOT attempt to fix any code yourself
4. NO HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED - delegate directly to test-fix-coordinator
5. VIOLATION = ORCHESTRATION FAILURE
```

## The Violation Pattern
1. Main assistant correctly invokes orchestrator with keywords ✅
2. Orchestrator receives "testing, debugging and fixing" ✅
3. **VIOLATION**: Orchestrator runs tests directly instead of delegating ❌

## Root Cause
The orchestrator agent is NOT following its own instructions despite:
- Clear rules at lines 21-32
- Repeated rules at lines 148-160
- Critical warning added at lines 7-19
- Keywords being properly passed

## Solution Required
The orchestrator needs to:
1. **DETECT** the keywords (testing/debugging/fixing)
2. **IMMEDIATELY** invoke Task tool with test-fix-coordinator
3. **NOT** run any commands first
4. **NOT** check anything first
5. **NOT** understand the situation first

## Test Pattern for Verification
When orchestrator receives ANY prompt containing "test", "testing", "debug", or "fix":
```python
# FIRST ACTION - NO OTHER STEPS
if "test" in prompt or "debug" in prompt or "fix" in prompt:
    Task(
        subagent_type="test-fix-coordinator",
        description="Execute test-fix cycle",
        prompt=original_prompt  # Pass ENTIRE context
    )
    # STOP - Do nothing else
```
