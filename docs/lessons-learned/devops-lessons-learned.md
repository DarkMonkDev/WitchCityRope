fix: Critical authentication and event persistence architecture fixes

Fixed fundamental architectural mismatch where frontend expected JWT tokens
but backend used httpOnly cookies, plus resolved critical event admin
persistence issues preventing sessions/tickets/volunteers from saving.

Authentication Architecture Fix (BFF Pattern Implementation):
- AuthenticationEndpoints.cs: Removed token from response body (proper BFF pattern)
- client.ts: Added withCredentials: true, removed Authorization header logic
- useAuth.ts: Removed all localStorage token handling and storage
- Frontend now uses httpOnly cookies exclusively via withCredentials: true
- Backend already had correct cookie authentication middleware configured

Event Persistence Issues Fixed:
- EventForm.tsx: Fixed form re-initialization destroying user changes with hasInitialized ref
- AdminEventDetailsPage.tsx: Added query client invalidation for proper data refresh
- Fixed form state management preventing persistence across page refreshes
- Resolved component re-mounting issues that destroyed form data

Technical Issues Resolved:
- Authentication mismatch: Frontend localStorage vs backend httpOnly cookies
- Form state loss: Component re-mounting destroying user input during updates
- Data persistence failure: Form values not syncing with API responses after refresh
- Session/ticket/volunteer data not persisting due to form lifecycle issues

Result: Authentication now works correctly with secure httpOnly cookies following
BFF pattern, and event admin forms persist all data reliably across page
refreshes and form operations. Both critical architectural problems resolved.

fix: Add missing VolunteerPositions navigation property to Event entity

Fixed critical volunteer positions persistence issue where volunteer position
changes weren't being saved to the database. The root cause was a missing
navigation property in the Event entity, preventing Entity Framework from
properly tracking and persisting volunteer position changes.

Backend Fixes:
- Event.cs: Added VolunteerPositions navigation property to Event entity
- ApplicationDbContext.cs: Added relationship configuration for Event->VolunteerPositions
- EventDto.cs: Added VolunteerPositions list to Event data transfer object
- VolunteerPositionDto.cs: NEW DTO class for volunteer position data transfer
- EventService.cs: Added Include statements for VolunteerPositions in all queries
- Migration files: Empty migration (relationships already exist in database)

Technical Issue Resolved:
- Entity Framework couldn't track volunteer position changes without navigation property
- Missing Include() statements prevented volunteer positions from loading with events
- DTO structure incomplete without VolunteerPositionDto and EventDto.VolunteerPositions
- All event queries now properly load volunteer positions with .Include(e => e.VolunteerPositions)

Result: Volunteer position changes now persist correctly across all event
operations including form submissions, page refreshes, and data updates.
The issue was Entity Framework tracking, not Docker or environment configuration.

## üö® CRITICAL: Authentication Fix Success - Logout Persistence Working (September 19, 2025)

### MAJOR SUCCESS: Authentication Logout Persistence Fixed (721050a)

**STATUS**: ‚úÖ Successfully resolved critical authentication issue where logout state wasn't persisting across page refreshes
- **Problem**: Users could logout but page refresh would restore authenticated state
- **Root Cause**: Simple logout middleware intercepting `/auth/logout` requests before auth controller
- **Solution**: Removed conflicting simple middleware, allowing proper logout endpoint handling
- **Verification**: E2E tests confirm logout now persists across page refreshes correctly

### Authentication Fix Success Pattern

**APPROACH**: Targeted middleware conflict resolution with specific E2E verification
```bash
# ‚úÖ GOOD - Stage only authentication fix and related documentation
git add apps/api/Program.cs \
        docs/lessons-learned/backend-developer-lessons-learned.md \
        tests/e2e/ \
        docs/architecture/file-registry.md

# ‚ùå BAD - Would include irrelevant build artifacts
git add -A  # Don't stage bin/obj files for targeted auth fixes
```

**COMMIT MESSAGE PATTERN**: Authentication fix with verification details
```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix: ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX - Authentication logout persistence now working correctly

Fixed critical authentication bug where users could logout but page refresh
would restore their authenticated state. Logout now persists correctly across
browser navigation and page refreshes.

Backend Fix:
- Program.cs: Removed simple logout middleware that was intercepting logout requests
- The simple middleware was returning responses before the auth controller could clear cookies
- Auth controller /auth/logout endpoint now properly handles logout operations

E2E Verification:
- Confirmed logout redirects to login page correctly
- Verified page refresh after logout maintains unauthenticated state
- Tested authentication state persistence across browser navigation
- All logout scenarios now work as expected

Technical Issue Resolved:
- Simple middleware .UseWhen() was intercepting /auth/logout requests before auth controller
- This prevented proper cookie clearing and session termination
- Removing the conflicting middleware allows normal auth controller flow
- Logout endpoint now processes completely without middleware interference

Result: Users can logout reliably and their session terminates properly
across all browser operations including page refreshes.

## ‚ùå RESOLVED: Teacher Selection API Issues (January 19, 2025)

### API Response Structure Mismatch - FIXED

**Issue**: Teacher selection was failing due to API response structure mismatch between expected flat user array and actual nested user.teachers structure.

**Root Cause**: Frontend expected `User[]` but API returned `{ user: { teachers: Teacher[] } }` structure.

**Solution Applied**: Updated API response handling to extract teachers correctly from nested structure.

**Files Changed**:
- `useEvents.ts`: Fixed API response transformation
- `EventForm.tsx`: Updated teacher selection handling

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Teacher selection now works correctly in event forms.

## ‚ùå RESOLVED: Event Filter Null Handling (January 19, 2025)

**Root Cause**: Filter functions not handling null/undefined event properties safely.

**Solution Applied**: Added comprehensive null checks and safe property access in all filter operations.

**Files Changed**:
- Event filtering components
- Filter utility functions

**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - Event filtering now handles null data gracefully.

## ‚ùå RESOLVED: Session Persistence Issues (January 19, 2025)

### Event Session Data Loss - FIXED

**Issue**: Event sessions weren't persisting correctly across page refreshes and form operations.

**Root Cause**: Multiple issues with form state management and API data transformation.

## Critical Git Staging Rules - Never Violate

### ‚ùå NEVER Stage These Files

**Build Artifacts** (Always exclude):
```bash
# Backend build artifacts
apps/api/bin/
apps/api/obj/
tests/*/bin/
tests/*/obj/

# Frontend build artifacts
apps/web/dist/
apps/web/node_modules/
apps/web/build/

# Test outputs
test-results/
tests/*/TestResults/
playwright-report/
apps/web/playwright-report/
tests/e2e/test-results/

# IDE and system files
.vs/
.vscode/settings.json (machine-specific)
*.tmp
*.cache
```

**Temporary/Debug Files**:
```bash
# Debug scripts and temporary files
scripts/debug/
*.tmp
cookies.txt
investigation-report-*.md
*-fixes-summary.md

# Screenshots and verification files
*.png (unless part of documentation)
tests/playwright/test-results/
```

### ‚úÖ ALWAYS Stage These Files

**Source Code Changes**:
```bash
# Frontend source code
apps/web/src/**/*.tsx
apps/web/src/**/*.ts
apps/web/src/**/*.css

# Backend source code
apps/api/**/*.cs
apps/*/Models/**/*.cs
apps/*/Services/**/*.cs

# Configuration files (when intentionally changed)
apps/web/package.json
apps/api/*.csproj
```

**Documentation Updates**:
```bash
# Always update file registry for any file operations
docs/architecture/file-registry.md

# Lessons learned updates
docs/lessons-learned/*.md

# Architecture and standards documentation
docs/architecture/*.md
docs/standards-processes/*.md
```

### üîç Verification Commands (Use Before Every Commit)

**Pre-Commit Checklist**:
```bash
# 1. Check what's staged
git diff --staged --name-only

# 2. Verify no build artifacts staged
git diff --staged --name-only | grep -E "(bin/|obj/|test-results/|playwright-report/)"

# 3. Check commit size is reasonable
git diff --staged --shortstat

# 4. Review actual changes
git diff --staged
```

**Post-Commit Verification**:
```bash
# 1. Verify commit succeeded
git status

# 2. Check commit details
git show --name-only HEAD

# 3. Verify clean working directory (only build artifacts remaining)
git status
```

## Documentation Update Requirements

### File Registry Maintenance - MANDATORY

**EVERY file operation MUST be logged in**: `/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`

**Required fields**:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- File Path (absolute)
- Action (CREATED/MODIFIED/DELETED/MOVED)
- Purpose (why file exists/was changed)
- Session/Task (what work this relates to)
- Status (ACTIVE/TEMPORARY/ARCHIVED/CLEANED)
- Cleanup Date (when to review/remove temporary files)

**Update file registry in EVERY commit that touches files**.

### Lessons Learned Updates

**When to update lessons learned files**:
- Discovered new problem/solution patterns
- Found better approaches to existing problems
- Resolved complex technical issues
- Learned new git workflow patterns
- Found debugging techniques that work
- Successful documentation maintenance patterns

**Files to update**:
- `/docs/lessons-learned/devops-lessons-learned.md` (for git/deployment issues)
- `/docs/lessons-learned/react-developer-lessons-learned.md` (for frontend issues)
- `/docs/lessons-learned/backend-developer-lessons-learned.md` (for API/backend issues)

## Recovery Procedures

### Failed Commit Recovery

**If commit fails due to conflicts or errors**:
```bash
# 1. Check what went wrong
git status
git log --oneline -3

# 2. If merge conflict during commit
git status  # Shows conflict files
# Edit conflict files manually
git add [resolved-files]
git commit  # Complete the commit

# 3. If need to reset and try again
git reset --soft HEAD~1  # Keep changes staged
git reset HEAD  # Unstage everything
# Re-stage selectively and commit again
```

### Wrong Files Committed Recovery

**If accidentally committed build artifacts**:
```bash
# 1. Soft reset to before bad commit (keeps changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# 2. Unstage everything
git reset HEAD

# 3. Re-stage only correct files
git add [correct-files-only]

# 4. Re-commit with proper files
git commit -m "..."
```

### Commit Message Error Recovery

**If commit message has errors**:
```bash
# 1. Amend the last commit message
git commit --amend

# 2. This opens editor to fix message
# Save and exit when done
```

## Success Metrics and Monitoring

### Commit Quality Indicators

**Good Commit Signs**:
- ‚úÖ Only source code and documentation files staged
- ‚úÖ Reasonable number of files (typically < 10 for focused changes)
- ‚úÖ Clear, descriptive commit message with technical details
- ‚úÖ File registry updated for any file operations
- ‚úÖ Lessons learned updated if new patterns discovered
- ‚úÖ Commit size reasonable (< 500 lines changed for most commits)

**Warning Signs** (Fix before committing):
- ‚ùå Build artifacts (bin/, obj/, test-results/) in staging
- ‚ùå Large number of files staged (> 20) without clear reason
- ‚ùå Massive line changes (> 1000 lines) without explanation
- ‚ùå Temporary/debug files included in commit
- ‚ùå Missing file registry updates
- ‚ùå Vague or non-descriptive commit message

### Post-Commit Verification

**Always verify after each commit**:
```bash
# 1. Commit succeeded cleanly
git status  # Should show only build artifacts remaining

# 2. Commit contains expected files only
git show --name-only HEAD

# 3. Commit message is clear and complete
git show HEAD

# 4. Working directory is clean of staged changes
git diff --name-only  # Should be empty or only build artifacts
```

## Future Improvements Tracking
