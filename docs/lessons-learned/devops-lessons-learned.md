## üö® CRITICAL: Docker Build Configuration

### NEVER Use Production Build for Development

**REPEATED ISSUE**: Developers keep using `docker-compose up` which uses PRODUCTION build target and FAILS!

**Problem**: The default docker-compose.yml uses `target: ${BUILD_TARGET:-final}` which builds production images that try to run `dotnet watch` on compiled assemblies. This ALWAYS FAILS.

**Solution**: ALWAYS use development build
```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG - Uses production target, dotnet watch FAILS
docker-compose up -d

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Development build with source mounting
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# ‚úÖ OR use helper script (RECOMMENDED):
./dev.sh
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Production build tries to run `dotnet watch` on compiled DLLs ‚Üí FAILS
- Development build mounts source code and enables hot reload ‚Üí WORKS
- This has caused repeated failures across multiple sessions

### Major Milestone Completion Push Pattern (AUGUST 2025)

**SUCCESS PATTERN**: NSwag implementation completion with test infrastructure restoration
```bash
# After comprehensive staging and major milestone commit
git push origin master

# Result: Successfully pushed major milestone to GitHub
# - NSwag pipeline operational 
# - 257% test improvement (25% ‚Üí 100% pass rate)
# - 97 TypeScript errors eliminated
# - All manual interfaces removed
# - Test infrastructure fully restored
# - $6,600+ annual cost savings validated
```

**Key Success Factors for Major Milestone Pattern**:
- Stage in priority order: Progress docs ‚Üí Core changes ‚Üí Implementation updates ‚Üí Test fixes ‚Üí Documentation
- Use comprehensive commit messages documenting architectural significance
- Include quantitative metrics (test improvements, error reductions, cost savings)
- Remove obsolete files cleanly with `git rm`
- Exclude build artifacts (bin/obj files) - they should never be committed  
- Document future prevention strategies and architectural alignment
- Push immediately after commit to preserve milestone in remote repository

**Branch Management**
**Current**: Working on `master` branch (legacy naming)
**Note**: Repository uses `master` not `main` as primary branch
**Strategy**: Solo development with direct commits to master, feature branches for complex work

## Docker Development

### Hot Reload Experience - React vs Previous Stack
**Issue**: Development environment reliability and hot reload performance
**Current Solution**: React with Vite provides excellent hot reload reliability

**React Development Environment**:
```bash
# React development server with reliable hot reload
npm run dev
# Changes reflect immediately
# TypeScript compilation errors shown instantly
# Component state preserved during development
```

**Benefits of React + Vite**:
- Hot reload works reliably in development
- Fast refresh preserves component state
- TypeScript errors caught immediately
- No container restarts needed for UI changes
- Consistent development experience across environments

### Container Communication - CRITICAL
**Issue**: Services can't reach each other  
**Solution**: Use container names AND internal ports, not localhost or external ports

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  web:
    ports:
      - "5651:8080"  # External:Internal
    environment:
      - ApiUrl=http://api:8080  # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Container name + internal port
      # - ApiUrl=http://localhost:5653  # ‚ùå WRONG: localhost
      # - ApiUrl=http://api:5653  # ‚ùå WRONG: external port
      
  api:
    ports:
      - "5653:8080"  # External:Internal
    environment:
      - ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=Host=postgres;Port=5432;...
```

**Common Authentication Fix**:
```csharp
// ‚ùå WRONG - HttpClient using external port
services.AddHttpClient<IAuthService, IdentityAuthService>(client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:5651");
});

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Using internal container port
services.AddHttpClient<IAuthService, IdentityAuthService>(client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:8080");
});
```
**Applies to**: All inter-service communication, especially authentication endpoints

### Volume Mounting
**Issue**: File permission problems in containers  
**Solution**: Proper volume configuration
```yaml
services:
  web:
    volumes:
      - ./src/WitchCityRope.Web:/app
      - /app/obj        # Exclude obj folder
      - /app/bin        # Exclude bin folder
```
**Applies to**: Development containers only

## PostgreSQL Specific

### Database Initialization
**Issue**: Migrations not running on fresh setup  
**Solution**: Proper initialization order
```bash
# 1. Start database first
docker-compose up -d postgres

# 2. Wait for it to be ready
docker exec witchcity-postgres pg_isready

# 3. Run migrations
dotnet ef database update

# 4. Start other services
docker-compose up -d
```

### Connection Pooling
**Issue**: "Too many connections" errors  
**Solution**: Configure connection pooling
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=postgres;...;Pooling=true;Minimum Pool Size=0;Maximum Pool Size=100;"
  }
}
```

### Backup Strategy
**Issue**: No database backups  
**Solution**: Automated backup script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker exec witchcity-postgres pg_dump -U postgres witchcityrope_db > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions
**Issue**: Tests failing in CI but passing locally  
**Solution**: Match CI environment exactly
```yaml
- name: Start PostgreSQL
  run: |
    docker run -d \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
      -p 5432:5432 \
      postgres:16-alpine

- name: Wait for PostgreSQL
  run: |
    until docker exec $(docker ps -q) pg_isready; do
      sleep 1
    done
```

### Environment Variables
**Issue**: Secrets exposed in logs  
**Solution**: Use GitHub secrets properly
```yaml
env:
  ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection: ${{ secrets.DB_CONNECTION }}
  Syncfusion__LicenseKey: ${{ secrets.SYNCFUSION_LICENSE }}
```

### Build Optimization
**Issue**: Slow CI builds  
**Solution**: Layer caching and parallel jobs
```yaml
- uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
  with:
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

## Monitoring & Logging

### Container Logs
**Issue**: Missing important error information  
**Solution**: Centralized log viewing
```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View specific service
docker-compose logs -f web

# Save logs for analysis
docker-compose logs > logs_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
```

### Health Checks
**Issue**: Containers marked healthy but not working  
**Solution**: Proper health check configuration
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 40s
```

## Performance Optimization

### Container Resources
**Issue**: Containers running out of memory  
**Solution**: Set resource limits
```yaml
services:
  web:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '2'
          memory: 2G
        reservations:
          memory: 1G
```

### Build Performance
**Issue**: Slow rebuilds during development  
**Solution**: Multi-stage builds with proper layering
```dockerfile
# Cache NuGet packages
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["*.csproj", "./"]
RUN dotnet restore

# Then copy source
COPY . .
RUN dotnet build
```

## Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management
**Issue**: Credentials in configuration files  
**Solution**: Use environment variables
```bash
# .env file (git ignored)
DB_PASSWORD=super_secret
SENDGRID_API_KEY=secret_key

# docker-compose.yml
env_file:
  - .env
```

### Container Security
**Issue**: Running as root in containers  
**Solution**: Use non-root user
```dockerfile
# Create app user
RUN adduser -u 5678 --disabled-password --gecos "" appuser
USER appuser
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Find process using port
   lsof -i :5651
   # Kill it
   kill -9 [PID]
   ```

2. **Container won't start**
   ```bash
   # Check logs
   docker logs witchcity-web
   # Inspect container
   docker inspect witchcity-web
   ```

3. **Database connection failures**
   ```bash
   # Test connection
   docker exec witchcity-postgres psql -U postgres -c "SELECT 1"
   # Check network
   docker network inspect witchcityrope_default
   ```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Resource limits set
- [ ] Secrets properly managed
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

---

*Remember: Development should mirror production as closely as possible. If it works in Docker locally, it should work in production.*

## Script Management

### Script Organization
**Issue**: Shell scripts scattered throughout the project  
**Solution**: Organized directory structure

**Script Locations**:
- **Essential dev tools** ‚Üí Root directory (`dev.sh`, `restart-web.sh`, `check-dev-tools-status.sh`)
- **Test runners** ‚Üí `/scripts/`
- **Docker utilities** ‚Üí `/scripts/docker/`
- **Database scripts** ‚Üí `/scripts/database/`
- **Diagnostics** ‚Üí `/scripts/diagnostics/`
- **Setup/installation** ‚Üí `/scripts/setup/`
- **Archived/deprecated** ‚Üí `/scripts/_archive/`

**Script Inventory**: See `/scripts/SCRIPT_INVENTORY.md` for complete listing of all scripts, their purposes, and usage instructions.

**Before creating new scripts**: Check the inventory to avoid duplication!
