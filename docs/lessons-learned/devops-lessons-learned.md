## üö® CRITICAL: Docker Build Configuration

### NEVER Use Production Build for Development

**REPEATED ISSUE**: Developers keep using `docker-compose up` which uses PRODUCTION build target and FAILS!

**Problem**: The default docker-compose.yml uses `target: ${BUILD_TARGET:-final}` which builds production images that try to run `dotnet watch` on compiled assemblies. This ALWAYS FAILS.

**Solution**: ALWAYS use development build
```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG - Uses production target, dotnet watch FAILS
docker-compose up -d

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Development build with source mounting
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# ‚úÖ OR use helper script (RECOMMENDED):
./dev.sh
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Production build tries to run `dotnet watch` on compiled DLLs ‚Üí FAILS
- Development build mounts source code and enables hot reload ‚Üí WORKS
- This has caused repeated failures across multiple sessions

## Git Operations

### Iterative Test Infrastructure Fix Commit Pattern (SEPTEMBER 2025) ‚úÖ

**SUCCESS PATTERN**: Comprehensive test infrastructure improvements from iterative debugging cycle with proper build artifact exclusion

**Achievement**: Successfully committed major test infrastructure improvements covering backend, React, and E2E tests with proper documentation

**Key Technical Decisions That Worked**:
1. **Comprehensive Build Artifact Exclusion** - Always reset apps/*/bin/, apps/*/obj/, src/*/bin/, src/*/obj/, tests/*/bin/, tests/*/obj/ before staging
2. **Iterative Fix Documentation** - Document quantitative improvements (compilation errors reduced 19.7%, warnings reduced 80.1%)
3. **Multi-Category Test Fixes** - Backend enum fixes, React selector improvements, E2E route corrections in single cohesive commit
4. **Pattern Establishment** - Document Mantine component testing patterns and selector strategies for future consistency
5. **Performance Metrics Tracking** - Document test coverage increases (+50 tests) and parallel worker validation (15x performance)

```bash
# Exclude ALL build artifacts (CRITICAL)
git reset apps/api/bin/ apps/api/obj/ src/WitchCityRope.Api/bin/ src/WitchCityRope.Api/obj/ src/WitchCityRope.Core/bin/ src/WitchCityRope.Core/obj/ src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure/bin/ src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure/obj/

### Critical Fix Cherry-Pick Strategy Pattern (SEPTEMBER 2025) ‚úÖ

**SUCCESS PATTERN**: Strategic cherry-picking of critical fixes with conflict resolution
```bash
# 1. Secure current work first
git add . && git commit -m "checkpoint: Save current work before cherry-picking critical fixes"

# 2. Cherry-pick fixes in order of criticality
git cherry-pick [security-fix-hash]     # Security fixes first
git cherry-pick [auth-fix-hash]         # Authentication fixes second
# Skip complex fixes that cause massive conflicts

# 3. For commits with too many conflicts, manually extract critical changes
# Rather than struggling with binary file conflicts and build artifacts
```

**Result**: Successfully applied critical fixes to feature branch
- ‚úÖ Security fix: .env.production removal (API key exposure prevention)
- ‚úÖ Authentication fix: Critical login bug preventing user access
- ‚úÖ Manual extraction: Missing GET /api/events/{id} endpoint
- ‚ùå Skipped: Complex commits with 100+ binary file conflicts

**Key Success Factors for Cherry-Pick Pattern**:
- Always commit current work before starting cherry-pick operations
- Prioritize fixes by criticality: Security ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Core functionality
- When conflicts involve many binary files (bin/obj), abort and extract manually
- Focus on source code fixes, ignore build artifact conflicts
- Test that build works after applying fixes
- Document which fixes were applied and which were skipped

**When to Use Manual Extraction vs Cherry-Pick**:
- **Cherry-pick**: Small, focused commits with minimal conflicts
- **Manual extraction**: Large commits affecting many files, especially with binary conflicts
- **Skip entirely**: Infrastructure changes that would require extensive conflict resolution

**Cherry-Pick Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
1. **Binary files (bin/obj)**: Always ignore these conflicts, reset them out
2. **Source code conflicts**: Resolve carefully, prioritizing current feature work
3. **Documentation conflicts**: Merge valuable content, skip outdated references
4. **Too many conflicts (50+)**: Abort and extract specific changes manually

### Script Organization and File Placement Enforcement Pattern (AUGUST 2025) ‚úÖ

**SUCCESS PATTERN**: Complete script organization with comprehensive developer agent zero-tolerance file placement enforcement
```bash
# Exclude build artifacts (CRITICAL)
git reset src/ tests/  # Reset any bin/obj/build artifacts

# Stage moved scripts and files in logical priority order
git add scripts/ docs/architecture/file-registry.md docs/guides-setup/ai-agents/ docs/lessons-learned/ docs/design/wireframes/test-form-designs.html

# Stage all deletions for removal
git add -u

# Move remaining test files to proper locations
mv tests/test-msw-setup.js tests/
git add tests/test-msw-setup.js

# Comprehensive script organization commit with HEREDOC
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
fix: Move misplaced scripts from root and enforce file placement rules

- Move 11 scripts from root to /scripts/ directory
- Move test-form-designs.html to /docs/design/wireframes/
- Move test-msw-setup.js to /tests/
- Update all developer agents with zero-tolerance file placement rules
- Add pre-work validation to prevent future violations
- Keep dev.sh in root for convenience

Fixes architecture violations where scripts and test files were
incorrectly placed in project root. All developer agents now enforce
proper file placement with validation before work begins.

### Critical Pre-Implementation Backup Pattern (AUGUST 2025) ‚úÖ

**SUCCESS PATTERN**: Multiple backup tags for granular rollback during major implementation work
```bash
# 1. Secure any uncommitted work first
git add docs/functional-areas/claude-code-parallel-sessions/
git commit -m "checkpoint: Save parallel sessions research before API implementation"

# 2. Create implementation backup tag at current commit
git tag backup/pre-implementation-2025-08-22 HEAD
git log --oneline HEAD -1   # Document exact commit hash: 5ad8c4e

# 3. Verify multiple backup points available
git tag -l "backup/*"
# backup/pre-api-modernization-2025-08-22     # Initial backup before specs
# backup/pre-implementation-2025-08-22       # Latest backup before code changes

# 4. Document rollback options
# Latest backup: backup/pre-implementation-2025-08-22 at commit 5ad8c4ed
# Includes: All specification work, parallel sessions research, stakeholder approvals
# Previous backup: backup/pre-api-modernization-2025-08-22 for complete rollback
```

**Result**: Granular rollback capability with multiple safety nets
- **Latest backup**: `backup/pre-implementation-2025-08-22` at commit `5ad8c4ed`
- **Complete specifications and stakeholder approvals preserved**
- **Parallel sessions research secured**
- **Ready for implementation with full rollback capability**

**Key Success Factors for Pre-Implementation Backup Pattern**:
- Always secure uncommitted work before creating backup tags
- Create granular backup points: pre-specs ‚Üí pre-implementation ‚Üí pre-testing
- Document exact commit hashes for emergency reference  
- Verify tag creation and availability of multiple rollback points
- Include all research and approval work in implementation backup
- Maintain clean working directory before beginning implementation
- Use descriptive tag names indicating stage and date

**When This Pattern Applies**:
- Before beginning actual code implementation after specification approval
- When transitioning from planning/research to development phases
- Before making changes that could affect multiple systems or components
- When preserving stakeholder approvals and requirement specifications
- Before complex implementation work where partial progress needs preservation

### Critical Pre-Refactoring Backup Pattern (AUGUST 2025) ‚úÖ

**SUCCESS PATTERN**: Complete backup strategy before major architectural refactoring with comprehensive rollback documentation
```bash
# 1. Verify current synchronization status
git fetch origin
git log origin/master..HEAD  # Check for unpushed commits
git log HEAD..origin/master  # Check for unsynced remote commits

# 2. Create dated backup tag at exact commit point
git tag backup/pre-api-modernization-2025-08-22 HEAD
git log --oneline HEAD -1   # Document exact commit hash: ec6ab07

# 3. Create feature branch for refactoring work
git checkout -b feature/2025-08-22-api-architecture-modernization

# 4. Secure any uncommitted work
git add session-work/  # Add any untracked session files
git commit -m "checkpoint: Save session work before API modernization refactoring"

# 5. Create comprehensive rollback documentation
# Document in ROLLBACK_PLAN_API_MODERNIZATION.md:
# - Backup tag and exact commit hash
# - Multiple rollback options (reset, recovery branch, cherry-pick)
# - Current working system state and architecture
# - Risk assessment for planned changes
# - Team coordination plan and communication strategy
# - Success criteria and performance requirements
# - Emergency verification steps
```

**Result**: Complete safety net established for major architectural refactoring
- Backup tag: `backup/pre-api-modernization-2025-08-22` at commit `ec6ab07`
- Comprehensive rollback plan with multiple recovery strategies
- Current working system documented (API startup 842ms, authentication functional)
- Team coordination plan for development pause/resume

**Key Success Factors for Pre-Refactoring Backup Pattern**:
- Always verify synchronization before creating backups (fetch origin first)
- Create dated backup tags with descriptive names for easy identification
- Document exact commit hashes for emergency reference
- Secure all uncommitted work before beginning major changes
- Create comprehensive rollback documentation with multiple recovery options
- Document current working state and architecture for comparison
- Include team coordination plan for when other teams depend on changes

**Branch Management**
**Current**: Working on `main` branch
**Note**: Repository uses `main` not `master` as primary branch  
**Strategy**: Solo development with feature branches for isolation, merge to main when complete

## Docker Development

### Hot Reload Experience - React vs Previous Stack
**Issue**: Development environment reliability and hot reload performance
**Current Solution**: React with Vite provides excellent hot reload reliability

**React Development Environment**:
```bash
# React development server with reliable hot reload
npm run dev
# Changes reflect immediately
# TypeScript compilation errors shown instantly
# Component state preserved during development
```

**Benefits of React + Vite**:
- Hot reload works reliably in development
- Fast refresh preserves component state
- TypeScript errors caught immediately
- No container restarts needed for UI changes
- Consistent development experience across environments

### Container Communication - CRITICAL
**Issue**: Services can't reach each other  
**Solution**: Use container names AND internal ports, not localhost or external ports

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  web:
    ports:
      - "5651:8080"  # External:Internal
    environment:
      - ApiUrl=http://api:8080  # ‚úÖ CORRECT: Container name + internal port
      # - ApiUrl=http://localhost:5653  # ‚ùå WRONG: localhost
      # - ApiUrl=http://api:5653  # ‚ùå WRONG: external port
      
  api:
    ports:
      - "5653:8080"  # External:Internal
    environment:
      - ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection=Host=postgres;Port=5432;...
```

**Common Authentication Fix**:
```csharp
// ‚ùå WRONG - HttpClient using external port
services.AddHttpClient<IAuthService, IdentityAuthService>(client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:5651");
});

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Using internal container port
services.AddHttpClient<IAuthService, IdentityAuthService>(client =>
{
    client.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://localhost:8080");
});
```
**Applies to**: All inter-service communication, especially authentication endpoints

### Volume Mounting
**Issue**: File permission problems in containers  
**Solution**: Proper volume configuration
```yaml
services:
  web:
    volumes:
      - ./src/WitchCityRope.Web:/app
      - /app/obj        # Exclude obj folder
      - /app/bin        # Exclude bin folder
```
**Applies to**: Development containers only

## PostgreSQL Specific

### Database Initialization
**Issue**: Migrations not running on fresh setup  
**Solution**: Proper initialization order
```bash
# 1. Start database first
docker-compose up -d postgres

# 2. Wait for it to be ready
docker exec witchcity-postgres pg_isready

# 3. Run migrations
dotnet ef database update

# 4. Start other services
docker-compose up -d
```

### Connection Pooling
**Issue**: "Too many connections" errors  
**Solution**: Configure connection pooling
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Host=postgres;...;Pooling=true;Minimum Pool Size=0;Maximum Pool Size=100;"
  }
}
```

### Backup Strategy
**Issue**: No database backups  
**Solution**: Automated backup script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
docker exec witchcity-postgres pg_dump -U postgres witchcityrope_db > backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions
**Issue**: Tests failing in CI but passing locally  
**Solution**: Match CI environment exactly
```yaml
- name: Start PostgreSQL
  run: |
    docker run -d \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
      -p 5432:5432 \
      postgres:16-alpine

- name: Wait for PostgreSQL
  run: |
    until docker exec $(docker ps -q) pg_isready; do
      sleep 1
    done
```

### Environment Variables
**Issue**: Secrets exposed in logs  
**Solution**: Use GitHub secrets properly
```yaml
env:
  ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection: ${{ secrets.DB_CONNECTION }}
  Syncfusion__LicenseKey: ${{ secrets.SYNCFUSION_LICENSE }}
```

### Build Optimization
**Issue**: Slow CI builds  
**Solution**: Layer caching and parallel jobs
```yaml
- uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v2
- uses: docker/build-push-action@v4
  with:
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
```

## Monitoring & Logging

### Container Logs
**Issue**: Missing important error information  
**Solution**: Centralized log viewing
```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View specific service
docker-compose logs -f web

# Save logs for analysis
docker-compose logs > logs_$(date +%Y%m%d).txt
```

### Health Checks
**Issue**: Containers marked healthy but not working  
**Solution**: Proper health check configuration
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 3
  start_period: 40s
```

## Performance Optimization

### Container Resources
**Issue**: Containers running out of memory  
**Solution**: Set resource limits
```yaml
services:
  web:
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          cpus: '2'
          memory: 2G
        reservations:
          memory: 1G
```

### Build Performance
**Issue**: Slow rebuilds during development  
**Solution**: Multi-stage builds with proper layering
```dockerfile
# Cache NuGet packages
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["*.csproj", "./"]
RUN dotnet restore

# Then copy source
COPY . .
RUN dotnet build
```

## Security Best Practices

### Secrets Management
**Issue**: Credentials in configuration files  
**Solution**: Use environment variables
```bash
# .env file (git ignored)
DB_PASSWORD=super_secret
SENDGRID_API_KEY=secret_key

# docker-compose.yml
env_file:
  - .env
```

### Container Security
**Issue**: Running as root in containers  
**Solution**: Use non-root user
```dockerfile
# Create app user
RUN adduser -u 5678 --disabled-password --gecos "" appuser
USER appuser
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Find process using port
   lsof -i :5651
   # Kill it
   kill -9 [PID]
   ```

2. **Container won't start**
   ```bash
   # Check logs
   docker logs witchcity-web
   # Inspect container
   docker inspect witchcity-web
   ```

3. **Database connection failures**
   ```bash
   # Test connection
   docker exec witchcity-postgres psql -U postgres -c "SELECT 1"
   # Check network
   docker network inspect witchcityrope_default
   ```

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:
- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Resource limits set
- [ ] Secrets properly managed
- [ ] Backup strategy in place
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

---

*Remember: Development should mirror production as closely as possible. If it works in Docker locally, it should work in production.*

## Script Management

### Script Organization
**Issue**: Shell scripts scattered throughout the project  
**Solution**: Organized directory structure

**Script Locations**:
- **Essential dev tools** ‚Üí Root directory (`dev.sh`, `restart-web.sh`, `check-dev-tools-status.sh`)
- **Test runners** ‚Üí `/scripts/`
- **Docker utilities** ‚Üí `/scripts/docker/`
- **Database scripts** ‚Üí `/scripts/database/`
- **Diagnostics** ‚Üí `/scripts/diagnostics/`
- **Setup/installation** ‚Üí `/scripts/setup/`
- **Archived/deprecated** ‚Üí `/scripts/_archive/`

**Script Inventory**: See `/scripts/SCRIPT_INVENTORY.md` for complete listing of all scripts, their purposes, and usage instructions.

**Before creating new scripts**: Check the inventory to avoid duplication!

## Database Auto-Initialization Implementation (August 22, 2025)

### MAJOR SUCCESS: Complete Infrastructure Implementation with TestContainers

**Achievement**: Reduced database setup time from 2-4 hours to under 5 minutes (95% improvement)

**Key Technical Decisions That Worked**:
1. **Milan Jovanovic's IHostedService Pattern** - Fail-fast BackgroundService with 30-second timeout
2. **Real PostgreSQL with TestContainers** - NO in-memory database (user was adamant, and rightfully so)
3. **Polly Retry Policies** - Exponential backoff (2s, 4s, 8s) for transient failures
4. **Respawn Library** - Fast database cleanup between tests
5. **Health Check Endpoint** - `/api/health/database` for monitoring readiness

**Performance Metrics**:
- API Startup: 842ms total (359ms for database initialization)
- 85% faster than the 2-second requirement
- Comprehensive seed data: 7 users, 12 events
- Test execution: Real PostgreSQL without mocking issues

**Critical Lesson Learned**:
When the user says "absolutely no in-memory database testing. We MUST use a real docker container with postgres database", they mean it. The TestContainers approach eliminated ALL ApplicationDbContext mocking issues and provides production parity for tests.

**Moq Extension Method Crisis Resolution**:
- **Problem**: `System.NotSupportedException: Unsupported expression: x => x.CreateScope()`
- **Root Cause**: Moq cannot mock extension methods
- **Solution**: Mock underlying interfaces instead:
  ```csharp
  // ‚ùå WRONG - Extension method
  Setup(x => x.CreateScope())
  
  // ‚úÖ CORRECT - Interface method
  Setup(x => x.GetService(typeof(IServiceScopeFactory)))
  ```

## Test Infrastructure Hardening and NuGet Updates (January 11, 2025)

### MAJOR SUCCESS: Complete Test Infrastructure Foundation with Zero False Failures

**Achievement**: Eliminated 172+ compilation errors and established reliable test foundation preventing false test failures

**Key Technical Decisions That Worked**:
1. **Systematic NuGet Updates** - All packages updated to latest .NET 9 compatible versions with zero NU1603 warnings
2. **TDD Approach Implementation** - 47 tests properly skipped for unimplemented features following TDD principles
3. **Comprehensive Health Check System** - ServiceHealthCheckTests validates all infrastructure in < 1 second
4. **Mandatory Health Check Requirements** - Added to ALL developer lessons learned files preventing #1 cause of false failures
5. **Session Work Organization** - Proper /session-work/YYYY-MM-DD/ structure with comprehensive test execution reports

**Performance Metrics**:
- NuGet Updates: 172+ compilation errors resolved, zero NU1603 version warnings
- Test Suite Restoration: 202/203 core tests passing (99.5% pass rate)
- Health Check Validation: < 1 second execution time preventing hours of debugging
- Infrastructure Reliability: React dev server (5173), API service (5655), PostgreSQL (5433), Docker containers

**Critical Lesson Learned**:
When implementing test infrastructure hardening, the health check system is absolutely critical. The ServiceHealthCheckTests approach prevents the #1 cause of false test failures: port misconfigurations and service unavailability. This eliminates hours of developer debugging time.

**Health Check Architecture Success**:
- **Problem**: Developers waste hours debugging port conflicts and missing services
- **Root Cause**: Tests run against unavailable or misconfigured infrastructure
- **Solution**: Mandatory pre-flight health checks with clear error messages and remediation steps
  ```csharp
  // Health check validates all required services before any test execution
  public class ServiceHealthCheckTests : IDisposable
  {
      [Fact(DisplayName = "All required services are accessible and healthy")]
      public async Task AllServices_ShouldBeHealthy()
      {
          // React dev server, API service, PostgreSQL database validation
          // Clear error messages with specific remediation steps
      }
  }
  ```

**Files Enhanced**:
- `/docs/lessons-learned/backend-lessons-learned.md` - CRITICAL mandatory health check requirements
- `/docs/lessons-learned/react-developer-lessons-learned.md` - Port validation and React dev server checks
- `/docs/lessons-learned/librarian-lessons-learned.md` - Testing documentation enhancement patterns
- `/session-work/2025-01-11/` - Complete session work organization with test execution reports

**Business Impact**:
