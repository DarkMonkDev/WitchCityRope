## üö® MANDATORY: Agent Handoff Documentation Process üö®

**CRITICAL**: This is NOT optional - handoff documentation is REQUIRED for workflow continuity.

### üìã WHEN TO CREATE HANDOFF DOCUMENTS
- **END of design phase** - BEFORE ending session
- **COMPLETION of wireframes/mockups** - Document design decisions
- **DISCOVERY of UX issues** - Share immediately
- **VALIDATION of user flows** - Document interaction patterns

### üìÅ WHERE TO SAVE HANDOFFS
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/handoffs/`
**Naming**: `ui-designer-YYYY-MM-DD-handoff.md`
**Template**: `/docs/standards-processes/agent-handoff-template.md`

### üìù WHAT TO INCLUDE (TOP 5 CRITICAL)
1. **Design Decisions**: Why specific UI choices were made
2. **User Flow Validation**: Approved interaction patterns
3. **Component Specifications**: Detailed UI component requirements
4. **Accessibility Requirements**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
5. **Responsive Behavior**: Mobile and tablet layout specifications

### ü§ù WHO NEEDS YOUR HANDOFFS
- **React Developers**: Component implementation requirements
- **Test Developers**: UI test scenarios and interaction patterns
- **Business Requirements**: User experience feedback and validation
- **Future UI Designers**: Design pattern consistency

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY READING BEFORE STARTING
**ALWAYS READ EXISTING HANDOFFS FIRST**:
1. Check `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/handoffs/` for previous design work
2. Read ALL handoff documents in the functional area
3. Understand design patterns already established
4. Build on existing UI consistency - don't create conflicting patterns

### üö® FAILURE TO CREATE HANDOFFS = IMPLEMENTATION FAILURES
**Why this matters**:
- React developers build wrong UI components
- User experience becomes inconsistent
- Design system violations accumulate
- Major UI rework required after development

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: Create handoff documents or workflow WILL fail.

## üö® MANDATORY: Use v7 Design System Standards (2025-08-20)

### Critical Design Authority
**ALL new designs MUST use the v7 design system as the single source of truth.**

#### Authority Documents (MUST READ BEFORE ANY DESIGN):
- **Template**: `/docs/design/current/homepage-template-v7.html`
- **Design System**: `/docs/design/current/design-system-v7.md`
- **Design Tokens**: `/docs/design/current/design-tokens-v7.json`
- **Animation Standards**: `/docs/design/implementation/animation-standards.md`
- **Component Library**: `/docs/design/implementation/component-library.md`

#### Key v7 Standards:
- **Colors**: Use ONLY the 23 approved colors from design-tokens-v7.json
- **Typography**: 4 Google Fonts (Bodoni Moda, Montserrat, Source Sans 3, Satisfy)
- **Animations**: 6 signature animations (nav underline, button morph, etc.)
- **Spacing**: 8px-based system
- **Components**: Use patterns from component-library.md

#### What NOT to Do:
- ‚ùå Create new color schemes
- ‚ùå Add new animations without documentation
- ‚ùå Use different fonts
- ‚ùå Ignore the established patterns

---

## üö® MANDATORY STARTUP PROCEDURE - READ FIRST üö®

### Critical Architecture Documents (MUST READ BEFORE ANY WORK):
1. **Migration Architecture**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/domain-layer-architecture.md`
2. **DTO Strategy**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/DTO-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md`
3. **Architecture Discovery Process**: `/docs/standards-processes/architecture-discovery-process.md`
4. **Migration Plan**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/migration-plan.md`

### Validation Gates (MUST COMPLETE):
- [ ] Read all architecture documents above
- [ ] Check if solution already exists
- [ ] Reference existing patterns in your work
- [ ] NEVER create manual DTO interfaces (use NSwag)

### UI Designer Specific Rules:
- **Check existing form components before designing new ones**
- **Ensure form designs work with generated DTO types from NSwag**
- **Reference Mantine v7 patterns from existing research**
- **All designs must accommodate API response structure (not idealized data)**

## üö® CRITICAL: FILE PLACEMENT RULES - ZERO TOLERANCE üö®

### NEVER Create Files in Project Root
**VIOLATIONS = IMMEDIATE WORKFLOW FAILURE**

### Mandatory File Locations:
- **HTML Wireframes**: `/docs/design/wireframes/`
- **Design Prototypes**: `/docs/functional-areas/[area]/wireframes/`
- **CSS Test Files**: `/docs/design/test-styles/`
- **Design Assets**: `/docs/design/assets/`
- **Style Guides**: `/docs/design/current/`
- **Animation Examples**: `/docs/design/animations/`

### Pre-Work Validation:
```bash
# Check for violations in project root
ls -la *.html *.css design-*.* wireframe-*.* style-*.* 2>/dev/null
# If ANY design files found in root = STOP and move to correct location
```

### Violation Response:
1. STOP all work immediately
2. Move files to correct locations
3. Update file registry
4. Continue only after compliance

### FORBIDDEN LOCATIONS:
- ‚ùå Project root for ANY design files
- ‚ùå Random HTML files outside design structure
- ‚ùå Style experiments in wrong locations
- ‚ùå Wireframes outside designated folders

## Overview
This document captures UI design lessons learned for the UI Designer agent role, including wireframe standards, design patterns, component specifications, and accessibility considerations. These lessons apply to design work that supports React component development and modern web applications.

## CRITICAL: UI Design First in Phase 2
**Issue**: UI design was happening after other technical designs
**Solution**: UI design must happen FIRST in Phase 2
- **Sequence**: UI Design ‚Üí Human Review ‚Üí Other Designs
- **Rationale**: Design changes can influence technical requirements
- **Impact**: Functional specifications may need updates based on UI
- **Human Review**: MANDATORY after UI design completion
- **Implementation**: ALWAYS create clickable mockups when possible
**Applies to**: All Phase 2 design work in orchestrated workflows

## Stakeholder Feedback Recovery Strategy (August 2025)

### When Design Direction Goes Wrong - Recovery Process
**Issue**: Gothic elegant variations were rejected as "terrible" and a "huge step backwards"
**Solution**: Immediate return to approved foundation with minimal, targeted refinements
- **Critical Insight**: When stakeholders reject design direction, go BACK to what they already approved
- **Recovery Pattern**: Approved base + specific loved elements + requested additions
- **Key Principle**: "Polish" not "redesign" when stakeholders are unhappy
- **Implementation**: Created 4 refined variations using exact approved wireframe structure
- **Success Factor**: Maintained ALL navigation structure, fonts, layout, and content they loved
**Business Impact**: Recovered stakeholder confidence through disciplined restraint

### Specific Element Preservation Strategy
**Issue**: Stakeholders have strong preferences for specific UI elements that must be preserved
**Solution**: Create element-specific implementation rules based on explicit feedback
- **Navigation Animation Rules**:
  - ‚úÖ **TOP NAV**: Color change + center-outward underline animation (LOVED)
  - ‚ùå **BUTTONS**: NO underline animation, only color/background change (RULE)
  - ‚ùå **FOOTER LINKS**: Just color change on hover, NO underlines (RULE)
- **Animation Restrictions**:
  - ‚ùå **COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN**: Mouse-following animations (stakeholder HATES)
  - ‚ùå **COMPLETELY FORBIDDEN**: Box-moving hover effects (stakeholder HATES)
  - ‚úÖ **APPROVED**: Simple color transitions and underlines in specific locations
**Key Learning**: Document exact implementation rules for loved/hated elements

### Refined Variation Strategy for Design Recovery
**Issue**: Need to provide options without overwhelming or repeating rejected directions
**Solution**: Create subtle variations of approved foundation rather than dramatically different approaches
- **Variation Types**:
  1. **Exact Approved** + specific additions (safest option)
  2. **Warmer Palette** + approved structure (subtle enhancement)
  3. **Modern Clean** + approved structure (contemporary feel)
  4. **Organic Flow** + approved structure (incorporate other loved elements)
- **Variation Rules**:
  - Keep EXACT navigation structure and menu items
  - Keep ALL fonts (Bodoni Moda, Montserrat, Source Sans 3)
  - Keep ALL layout and content sections
  - Add ONLY what was specifically requested (classes/events section)
  - Apply loved animation ONLY where stakeholder specifically approved it
**Business Value**: Provides stakeholder choice while maintaining design safety

### Design Element Categorization for Stakeholder Management
**Issue**: Need clear rules for what design elements are safe to modify vs. sacred
**Solution**: Categorize all design elements based on stakeholder feedback intensity
- **SACRED (Never Change)**:
  - Navigation structure and menu items
  - Font choices (Bodoni Moda, Montserrat, Source Sans 3)
  - Overall layout and content sections
  - Any element stakeholder explicitly "LOVES"
- **REFINABLE (Subtle Changes OK)**:
  - Color saturation and warmth
  - Border radius (within reason)
  - Spacing and padding (minor adjustments)
  - Shadow intensity
- **ADDITIVE (Can Add If Requested)**:
  - New sections (like classes/events)
  - Specific animations stakeholder requests
  - Enhanced versions of existing elements
- **FORBIDDEN (Never Add)**:
  - Any element stakeholder explicitly "HATES"
  - Design patterns from rejected variations
  - Complex animations or interactions not specifically approved
**Application**: Use this categorization for ALL future design decisions

### Documentation Strategy for Design Recovery
**Issue**: Need clear documentation when recovering from rejected design directions
**Solution**: Create comprehensive documentation that emphasizes preservation and minimal change
- **Documentation Elements**:
  - Explicit statement of what's preserved from approved design
  - Clear explanation of minimal changes made
  - Emphasis on "refinement" vs "redesign" language
  - Timeline estimates showing conservative approach
  - Technical notes confirming component readiness
- **Language Strategy**:
  - Use "refined" not "new" in all descriptions
  - Emphasize "polish" and "enhance" over "create" or "design"
  - Reference stakeholder feedback directly
  - Show restraint and discipline in approach
**Key Insight**: Documentation language should reinforce design conservatism when recovering

### Advanced Form Highlighting Techniques (August 2025)
**Research Discovery**: Modern form field highlighting goes beyond simple borders
**Solutions Implemented**:

#### 3D Elevation Effects
- **Technique**: Multi-layered shadows with `translateY` transforms and subtle rotation
- **Implementation**: 4-layer shadow system with `rotateX(2deg)` and `rotateZ(0.5deg)`
- **Performance**: GPU-accelerated transforms with `transform3d()` and selective `will-change`
- **Mobile Optimization**: Disabled on mobile, simple border focus only
```css
/* Key technique: Layered shadows for realistic depth */
box-shadow: 
  0 8px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25),     /* Ambient shadow */
  0 4px 15px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.2), /* Direct shadow */
  0 2px 8px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.3),  /* Accent glow */
  0 1px 3px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.4);  /* Inner glow */
```

#### Neon Ripple Spotlight System
- **Multi-Effect Approach**: Combines neon glow, position-aware ripples, and spotlight dimming
- **Dynamic Positioning**: Ripples originate from exact click coordinates using CSS custom properties
- **Spotlight Mechanics**: Radial gradient overlay with real-time position tracking
- **Performance Strategy**: Effects gracefully degrade based on device capabilities
```css
/* Key technique: Position-aware ripple effects */
background: radial-gradient(
  circle at var(--ripple-x, 50%) var(--ripple-y, 50%),
  rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.4) 0%, 
  transparent 70%
);
```

### Design Pattern Selection Strategy
**Issue**: Multiple design patterns need clear usage guidelines  
**Solution**: Context-driven design selection framework
- **Primary Recommendation**: 3D Elevation for premium registration/onboarding experiences

**Solution**: Graduated complexity based on device capabilities
```typescript
const usePerformanceOptimizedDesign = () => {
  const isMobile = useMediaQuery('(max-width: 767px)');
  const prefersReducedMotion = useMediaQuery('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');
  const isLowPerformance = navigator.hardwareConcurrency < 4;
  
  return {
    enable3D: !isMobile && !prefersReducedMotion && !isLowPerformance,
    enableNeon: !isLowPerformance,
    enableRipple: !prefersReducedMotion && !isLowPerformance,
    shadowLayers: isLowPerformance ? 1 : isMobile ? 2 : 4,
    animationDuration: isLowPerformance ? '0.2s' : '0.8s'
  };
};
```
**Key Insights**:
- Use hardware acceleration (`transform3d`) for smooth animations
- Apply `will-change` sparingly and remove after animations
- Provide solid color fallbacks for complex gradients
- Implement device capability detection for effect selection

### 2025 UI Trend Integration
**Research Findings**: Key trends for modern form design
- **Lightning Dark**: Enhanced dark mode with dynamic lighting effects
- **Gradient Renaissance**: Subtle to bold gradients for depth and AI indication

- **Spotlight UX**: Dynamic focus highlighting that dims non-active elements
**Implementation**: All patterns incorporate relevant 2025 trends while maintaining accessibility

### Advanced CSS Animation Techniques
**Research Discovery**: Modern CSS capabilities enable sophisticated form interactions
**Key Techniques Mastered**:

#### Multi-Layer Shadow Systems
```css
/* Realistic depth with 4 shadow layers */
box-shadow: 
  0 8px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25),     /* Ground contact shadow */
  0 4px 15px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.2), /* Colored ambient shadow */
  0 2px 8px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.3),  /* Sharp accent glow */
  0 1px 3px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.4);  /* Inner highlight */
```

#### CSS Custom Properties for Dynamic Effects
```css
/* Dynamic positioning using CSS variables */
.ripple-effect {
  background: radial-gradient(
    circle at var(--ripple-x, 50%) var(--ripple-y, 50%),
    rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.4) 0%, 
    transparent 70%
  );
}
```

#### Hardware-Accelerated Transforms
```css
/* GPU acceleration for smooth performance */
.elevation-field {
  transform: translate3d(0, -6px, 0) rotateX(2deg) rotateZ(0.5deg);
  will-change: transform, box-shadow;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}
```

### Accessibility in Advanced Form Designs
**Issue**: Complex animations can impact accessibility
**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Motion Respect**: All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`
- **Focus Alternatives**: Non-animated focus indicators for users who disable motion
- **Screen Reader Support**: ARIA live regions announce state changes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All effects work with keyboard-only interaction
- **Color Independence**: Effects work without color perception
```tsx
// Accessibility pattern for complex animations
const useAccessibleAnimations = () => {
  const prefersReducedMotion = useMediaQuery('(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)');
  
  return {
    enableAnimations: !prefersReducedMotion,
    focusIndicator: prefersReducedMotion ? 'border' : 'full-effect',
    transitionDuration: prefersReducedMotion ? '0s' : '0.3s'
  };
};
```

### Mantine v7 Advanced Patterns
**Discovery**: Advanced Mantine v7 capabilities for sophisticated forms
```typescript
// Gradient border effects with Mantine styling
const gradientBorderStyles = {
  '&::before': {
    content: '""',
    position: 'absolute',
    background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.8) 0%, rgba(180, 113, 113, 0.6) 100%)',
    borderRadius: 'inherit',
    opacity: 0,
    transition: 'opacity 0.3s ease'
  },
  '&:focus::before': {
    opacity: 1
  }
}

// 3D perspective container setup
const perspective3D = {
  perspective: '1200px',
  perspectiveOrigin: 'center top',
  transformStyle: 'preserve-3d'
}

// Neon glow animation system
const neonGlowAnimation = {
  '@keyframes neonPulse': {
    '0%, 100%': {
      boxShadow: '0 0 5px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.5), 0 0 10px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.3)'
    },
    '50%': {
      boxShadow: '0 0 8px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.8), 0 0 15px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.5), 0 0 20px rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.3)'
    }
  }
}
```
**Performance Considerations**: 
- Use CSS custom properties for dynamic gradients
- Implement fallbacks for older browsers
- Optimize backdrop-filter usage
- Provide solid color alternatives for accessibility

### AI Content Integration Patterns
**Innovation**: Visual patterns for AI-generated form content
```typescript
// AI content indicator
const AIIndicator = () => (
  <Box
    style={{
      background: 'linear-gradient(135deg, #9b4a75 0%, #880124 100%)',
      color: 'white',
      padding: '2px 6px',
      borderRadius: '12px',
      fontSize: '10px',
      fontWeight: 600,
      textTransform: 'uppercase',
      letterSpacing: '0.5px'
    }}
  >
    AI
  </Box>
);

// Shimmer loading effect for AI processing
const shimmerAnimation = {
  '&::before': {
    background: 'linear-gradient(90deg, transparent 0%, rgba(155, 74, 117, 0.4) 50%, transparent 100%)',
    animation: 'shimmer 1.5s infinite'
  }
}
```
**Purpose**: Clear visual distinction for AI-enhanced form features
**Accessibility**: Maintains screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA labels

## Wireframe Standards

### File Organization
**Issue**: Wireframes scattered across multiple folders  
**Solution**: Keep wireframes with their functional area
```
functional-areas/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ events-management/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wireframes/           # HTML wireframe files
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ event-list.html
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ event-detail.html
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ current-state/
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wireframes.md     # Documentation about wireframes
```
**Applies to**: All new wireframe creation

### Naming Conventions
**Issue**: Inconsistent file names making them hard to find  
**Solution**: Use descriptive, hyphenated names
```
‚úÖ CORRECT:
- user-dashboard-overview.html
- event-creation-form.html
- admin-vetting-review.html

‚ùå WRONG:
- dashboard.html
- new_event.html
- AdminVetting.html
```
**Applies to**: All wireframe files

## Design Patterns

### Mobile-First Approach
**Issue**: Wireframes only showing desktop view  
**Solution**: Always design mobile view first
```html
<!-- Include viewport meta tag -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

<!-- Use responsive classes -->
<div class="container">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
      <!-- Content -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
**Applies to**: All new wireframes

### Component Consistency
**Issue**: Same UI element designed differently across pages  
**Solution**: Reference the component library
- Check `standards-processes/ui-components/` for existing components
- Use consistent button styles, form layouts, etc.
- Don't reinvent existing patterns
- **Phase 2 Priority**: Complete UI design BEFORE other technical designs
- **Human Review**: MUST pause after UI completion for approval

### Accessibility Considerations
**Issue**: Wireframes missing accessibility features  
**Solution**: Include accessibility annotations
```html
<!-- Add aria labels and roles -->
<button aria-label="Close dialog" role="button">√ó</button>

<!-- Include skip navigation -->
<a href="#main-content" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>

<!-- Annotate color contrast requirements -->
<!-- Note: Text must have 4.5:1 contrast ratio -->
```
**Applies to**: All interactive elements

## OAuth and Authentication UX Patterns

### OAuth Provider Selection (Research: Aug 2025)
**Issue**: Need to choose OAuth provider for small community sites  
**Solution**: Clerk is optimal for WitchCityRope's needs
- **Best for small communities**: Clerk ($550/month for 10k MAU)
- **Quick implementation**: Under 5 minutes for basic setup
- **Professional appearance**: Beautiful pre-built components
- **Avoid**: Custom OAuth (security complexity), Auth0 (too expensive)

### OAuth Button Design
**Pattern**: Follow 2024-2025 UX best practices
```jsx
// OAuth Button Layout
<VStack spacing={3}>
  <Button
    width="100%"
    leftIcon={<FaGoogle />}
    onClick={() => signInWithOAuth('google')}
    colorScheme="red"
    variant="outline"
  >
    Continue with Google
  </Button>
  <Divider />
  <Text fontSize="sm" color="gray.500">OR</Text>
  <Input placeholder="Email" />
  <Input type="password" placeholder="Password" />
</VStack>
```

### Mobile OAuth Considerations
**Issue**: OAuth flows need mobile optimization  
**Solution**: Thumb zone optimization
- Place OAuth buttons in bottom 1/3 of screen
- Use full-width buttons on mobile
- Implement one-handed use patterns
- 53% of users abandon sites taking >3 seconds to load

### Age Verification for Adult Sites
**Critical**: COPPA compliance requirements (effective June 2025)  
**Solution**: Cannot collect personal info before age determination
```jsx
const handleOAuthSuccess = async (userData) => {
  // Check if OAuth provider includes age/birthdate
  if (userData.ageVerified && userData.age >= 18) {
    await registerUser(userData);
  } else {
    router.push('/verify-age');
  }
};
```

### Session Management UX
**Pattern**: "Remember me" with refresh tokens
- Access tokens: 15 minutes
- Refresh tokens: 30 days  
- Remember me: 90 days
- Always validate server-side

## Docker Architecture Design Patterns (August 2025)

```
**Best Practice**: Include port mappings, container names, and communication protocols

### Multi-Environment Strategy Visualization
**Issue**: Complex docker-compose override patterns hard to understand  
**Solution**: Layer-based documentation with inheritance diagrams
```
Base (docker-compose.yml)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Development (docker-compose.dev.yml)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Test (docker-compose.test.yml)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Production (docker-compose.prod.yml)
```
**Pattern**: Show configuration matrix comparing environments

### Service Communication Flow Design
**Issue**: Container networking can be confusing for developers  
**Solution**: Sequence diagrams showing authentication flows
- Show external browser ‚Üí container communication
- Highlight internal container-to-container calls
- Document service discovery patterns

2. Title and scene name
3. Date, time, location
4. Price and ticket availability
5. Description
6. RSVP/Buy button

### User Dashboard Sections
**Standard organization**:
1. Welcome message with user name
2. Upcoming events (RSVPs and tickets)
3. Quick actions (browse events, update profile)
4. Recent activity
5. Settings link

### Form Layouts
**Consistent form structure**:
1. Clear heading
2. Required field indicators (*)
3. Field grouping with sections
4. Help text under fields
5. Clear primary action button
6. Cancel/back option

### Authentication Flow for Adult Community
**Privacy-first approach**:
1. OAuth login with age verification
2. Default profile to private
3. Explicit consent for photo sharing
4. Role assignment (start as 'guest')
5. Clear privacy controls

## Integration with Development

### Data Attributes
**Issue**: Developers can't identify elements from wireframes  
**Solution**: Add data-testid attributes
```html
<button data-testid="submit-event">Create Event</button>
<div data-testid="event-list">
  <div data-testid="event-card">...</div>
</div>
```
**Applies to**: All interactive elements

### State Representations
**Issue**: Only showing happy path  
**Solution**: Design all states
- Empty states (no data)
- Loading states (critical for OAuth flows)
- Error states with recovery options
- Success messages
- Validation errors

### Error Handling for OAuth
**Pattern**: Clear error communication with recovery
```jsx
<Alert status="error">
  <AlertIcon />
  <AlertTitle>Google Login Failed</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    Please check your Google account permissions and try again.
    <Link href="/login/email">Use email/password instead</Link>
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
**Issue**: Unclear how design adapts

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Creating in isolation** - Always check existing components first
2. **Desktop-only thinking** - Mobile users are significant
3. **Perfect pixel designs** - Focus on layout and flow
4. **Missing edge cases** - What if OAuth fails? Network issues?
5. **Ignoring accessibility** - Consider keyboard navigation, screen readers
6. **Skipping loading states** - OAuth flows have significant wait times
7. **Custom OAuth implementation** - Use proven providers like Clerk
8. **Complex Docker diagrams** - Keep ASCII art simple and focused
9. **Missing container communication** - Show internal vs external traffic
10. **Incomplete environment coverage** - Document dev, test, and production
11. **Over-designing forms** - Balance sophistication with usability
12. **Ignoring performance** - Test complex designs on mobile devices
13. **Skipping gradient fallbacks** - Always provide solid color alternatives
14. **Overusing 3D effects** - Apply selectively for premium experiences only
15. **Motion without purpose** - Every animation should serve user experience
16. **Performance assumptions** - Always test on target devices before implementing
17. **Single design solution** - Always provide progressive variation options for stakeholder comfort
18. **Ignoring edginess scale** - Community authenticity requires appropriate alternative aesthetic
19. **Template cargo cult** - Adapt patterns to community needs, don't blindly copy
20. **Missing hybrid options** - Combine best elements from multiple approaches
21. **Inconsistent page designs** - Each page should align with overall design system while serving specific functions
22. **Oversimplified event filtering** - Community events require sophisticated discovery mechanisms
23. **Ignoring member access levels** - Alternative communities have complex privacy and safety requirements
24. **Static wireframes only** - Interactive prototypes provide better stakeholder understanding
25. **Stakeholder feedback rejection** - Never ignore explicit feedback (e.g., "no neon colors")
26. **Description-only designs** - Stakeholders need to SEE and EXPERIENCE designs, not read about them
27. **Single aesthetic approach** - Always provide progressive variation options for different comfort levels
28. **Missing template research integration** - Link wireframes to research foundation for credibility
29. **No decision support framework** - Include comparison matrices and implementation guidance
30. **Ignoring underline animation requirements** - When stakeholder specifically loves a feature, make it prominent
31. **Mouse-following animations** - Completely eliminate when stakeholder explicitly hates them
32. **Moving boxes on hover** - Avoid any hover effects that move containers or cards
33. **Vibrant energy aesthetics** - Replace with sophisticated dark elegance when stakeholder rejects
34. **Missing organic layout principles** - Always reference beloved original design patterns
35. **Rejecting approved foundations** - When stakeholders reject new directions, return to what they already approved
36. **Dramatic redesigns during recovery** - Use "polish" and "refinement" approach when stakeholders are unhappy
37. **Ignoring specific element feedback** - Document exact rules for loved/hated UI elements
38. **Overcomplicating refinements** - Keep variations subtle when recovering from design rejection

## Form Design Patterns (2025-08-23)

### Context
Critical design patterns learned from form implementation requiring precise visual coordination between floating labels, placeholders, and user feedback systems.

### Form Design Requirements Precision
- **Specify exact visual behavior** - "hide placeholder by default, show when focused AND empty"
- **Include all input types** - TextInput, PasswordInput, Textarea components
- **Describe edge cases** - empty states, focused states, with helper text
- **Provide visual examples** when possible to prevent misunderstandings
- **Define success criteria** for testing and validation

### Floating Label Design Patterns
- **Floating labels position relative to input containers** - NOT form groups
- **Helper text separation** - design separate containers to prevent positioning conflicts
- **Focus state visual feedback** - border colors AND outline removal are different requirements
- **Smooth transitions** - 0.2s ease-in-out for professional appearance
- **Brand consistency** - use project color palette for focus states

### Form Field Highlighting Strategies
- **Multi-layered approach** - border changes, placeholder visibility, label animation
- **Component-specific considerations** - password inputs have different CSS targeting requirements
- **Performance optimization** - CSS-only solutions preferred over React state management
- **Accessibility compliance** - ensure all visual feedback works for keyboard navigation

### Communication Patterns for Form Design
- **Avoid vague requirements** - "Fix placeholder visibility" leads to misunderstands
- **Specify component types** - list all input components that need the behavior
- **Include edge case handling** - describe behavior for different states
- **Provide visual mockups** - screenshots prevent interpretation errors
- **Define clear acceptance criteria** - what constitutes successful implementation

### Action Items
- [ ] COMMUNICATE form design requirements with specific visual descriptions
- [ ] SPECIFY behavior for all relevant input types in designs
- [ ] DESIGN for floating label and helper text interaction patterns
- [ ] INCLUDE focus state specifications in all form designs
- [ ] PROVIDE edge case handling guidance in design specifications
- [ ] TEST design concepts across different input component types

*Remember: Wireframes are communication tools. Clear annotations and consistency are more valuable than pixel perfection. For OAuth flows, prioritize security and compliance over complexity. For Docker designs, focus on developer experience and clear service communication patterns. For modern forms, balance sophistication with performance and accessibility - create designs that are both beautiful and functional. Advanced form effects should enhance the user experience, not overwhelm it. Design variations should provide stakeholder comfort through progressive options, allowing selection based on desired impact, timeline, and community feedback. Events pages require sophisticated discovery mechanisms while maintaining design system coherence across all page types. ALWAYS create interactive wireframes when possible - stakeholders need to experience designs, not imagine them. Integrate stakeholder feedback immediately and provide progressive variation options for decision-making comfort. For Gothic elegant designs, remember that underline animations are essential and beloved - feature them prominently while avoiding any mouse-following or box-moving effects that stakeholders hate. When stakeholders reject design directions, immediately return to approved foundations with minimal, targeted refinements. Document specific rules for loved vs. hated UI elements to prevent future mistakes.*
