## üö® CRITICAL: WORKTREE COMPLIANCE - MANDATORY üö®

### ALL WORK MUST BE IN THE SPECIFIED WORKTREE DIRECTORY

**VIOLATION = CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**

When given a Working Directory like:
`/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/.worktrees/feature-2025-08-24-events-management`

**YOU MUST:**
- Write ALL files to paths within the worktree directory
- NEVER write to `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/` main repository
- ALWAYS use the full worktree path in file operations
- VERIFY you're in the correct directory before ANY file operation

**Example:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/.worktrees/feature-2025-08-24-events-management/docs/...`
- ‚ùå WRONG: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/...`

**Why This Matters:**
- Worktrees isolate feature branches
- Writing to main repo pollutes other branches
- Can cause merge conflicts and lost work
- BREAKS the entire development workflow

## Overview
Critical lessons learned for the test-executor agent, including mandatory E2E testing prerequisites, common failure patterns, file organization standards, and React component testing patterns.

## üö® MAJOR UPDATE: RSVP Business Rules Testing - Implementation Gap Discovery (2025-09-07)

### Critical Discovery: RSVP Functionality Not Implemented

**CRITICAL FINDING**: User request for RSVP business rules testing revealed that the mentioned EventsManagementService and RSVP functionality **are not yet implemented** in the codebase, despite backend fixes being mentioned.

**Test Execution Summary**:
- **Test Date**: 2025-09-07T19:40:24.838Z
- **Test Type**: RSVP Business Rules Validation
- **Tests Run**: 7 comprehensive tests across API and frontend
- **Results**: 7 PASSED (test execution), 0% RSVP functionality implemented
- **Environment**: React (5174), API (5655) - Both healthy
- **Critical Discovery**: Basic events API working, but EventType and RSVP systems missing

### Implementation Reality vs. User Expectations

**What User Expected**:
- EventsManagementService working with EventType field
- API endpoint `/api/v1/events-management`
- RSVP endpoints with business rules:
  - Social Events ‚Üí Allow RSVP
  - Workshops ‚Üí Reject RSVP, show tickets only
  - Performances ‚Üí Reject RSVP, show tickets only
- Frontend UI with appropriate buttons

**What Actually Exists**:
- ‚úÖ Basic `/api/events` endpoint (4 events)
- ‚ùå No EventType field in API responses
- ‚ùå `/api/v1/events-management` returns 404
- ‚ùå All RSVP endpoints return 404
- ‚ùå No RSVP/ticket buttons in UI
- ‚ùå No event type differentiation

### Key Testing Methodology: Feature Readiness Assessment

**Successful Pattern for Feature Testing**:

1. **Assumption Validation** (CRITICAL NEW STEP):
   ```bash
   # ALWAYS verify user assumptions before deep testing
   curl -f http://localhost:5655/api/v1/events-management  # 404 - not implemented
   curl -f http://localhost:5655/api/events                # 200 - working
   ```

2. **Implementation Gap Analysis**:
   - Test mentioned endpoints before assuming they exist
   - Distinguish between "fixed backend" and "implemented feature"
   - Document what exists vs. what's expected

3. **Evidence-Based Reporting**:
   - Concrete API status codes (404 = not implemented)
   - Screenshot evidence of missing UI components
   - JSON reports with specific implementation gaps

### Testing Strategy: Expectation vs. Reality Mapping

**Pattern That Worked**:
```typescript
// Test user's expected endpoints
const v1Response = await page.request.get('/api/v1/events-management');
console.log(`V1 Endpoint Status: ${v1Response.status()}`); // 404

// Test what actually exists  
const baseResponse = await page.request.get('/api/events');
console.log(`Base Events Status: ${baseResponse.status()}`); // 200

// Analyze the gap
const events = await baseResponse.json();
const hasEventType = events.some(e => e.eventType || e.EventType);
console.log(`EventType field present: ${hasEventType}`); // false
```

### Content-Based Event Type Inference

**Successful Workaround for Missing EventType**:
```javascript
// When EventType field missing, infer from content
const predictEventType = (title, description) => {
  const content = (title + ' ' + description).toLowerCase();
  
  if (content.includes('social')) return 'social';
  if (content.includes('workshop') || content.includes('learn')) return 'workshop';  
  if (content.includes('performance')) return 'performance';
  
  return 'unknown';
};

// Results from actual events:
// "Introduction to Rope Bondage" ‚Üí workshop (should NOT allow RSVP)
// "Midnight Rope Performance" ‚Üí performance (should NOT allow RSVP)
// "Monthly Rope Social" ‚Üí social (should ALLOW RSVP)
// "Advanced Suspension Techniques" ‚Üí workshop (should NOT allow RSVP)
```

### Comprehensive Test Coverage When Feature Missing

**Testing Strategy for Unimplemented Features**:

1. **Environment Health** - Verify infrastructure works
2. **API Endpoint Discovery** - Map what exists vs. expected
3. **Data Structure Analysis** - Check for required fields
4. **Frontend Route Testing** - Verify pages load correctly
5. **Business Logic Simulation** - Test expected behavior patterns
6. **Implementation Gap Documentation** - Prioritize missing pieces

### Implementation Priority Assessment

**Quantified Readiness Analysis**:
```json
{
  "rsvpFunctionalityReadiness": {
    "basicEventsAPI": 100,        // ‚úÖ Working
    "eventTypeClassification": 0, // ‚ùå Missing EventType field  
    "rsvpBackendAPI": 0,         // ‚ùå No RSVP endpoints
    "rsvpFrontendUI": 0,         // ‚ùå No RSVP buttons
    "businessRulesLogic": 0,     // ‚ùå No type-based restrictions
    "overallReadiness": 20       // 20% ready (infrastructure only)
  }
}
```

### Developer Task Prioritization from Test Results

**Critical Path for RSVP Implementation**:
1. **Backend Developer** (BLOCKING): Add EventType field to API
2. **Backend Developer** (BLOCKING): Implement RSVP endpoints  
3. **React Developer**: Add conditional UI buttons based on event type
4. **Integration Testing**: Test complete RSVP workflow

**Estimated Timeline**:
- Backend work: 6-10 hours
- Frontend work: 3-5 hours  
- Integration & testing: 2-4 hours
- **Total**: 2-3 development days

### False Positive Prevention

**Critical Lesson**: User descriptions of "backend is fixed" may refer to:
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure improvements (containers, services)  
- ‚úÖ General API health fixes
- ‚ùå NOT specific feature implementation

**Always verify feature claims independently** through direct API testing.

### Test Automation for Feature Gaps

**Successful Automated Gap Detection**:
```typescript
// Automatically detect implementation gaps
const testFeatureReadiness = async () => {
  const checks = [
    { name: 'EventType Field', test: () => events.some(e => e.eventType) },
    { name: 'RSVP Endpoints', test: () => rsvpResponse.status() !== 404 },
    { name: 'UI Buttons', test: () => page.locator('[data-testid*="rsvp"]').count() > 0 }
  ];
  
  return checks.map(check => ({
    feature: check.name,
    implemented: check.test(),
    priority: 'HIGH'
  }));
};
```

### Communication Pattern for Unimplemented Features

**Report Structure for Missing Features**:
```markdown
## RSVP Business Rules Testing Results

‚ùå **FEATURE NOT IMPLEMENTED**

**Expected** (from user request):
- EventsManagementService with EventType
- RSVP business rules functionality
- Conditional UI based on event types

**Actual** (from testing):  
- Basic events API working (4 events)
- No EventType classification
- No RSVP endpoints or UI

**Next Steps**:
1. Backend: Implement EventType field
2. Backend: Create RSVP API endpoints  
3. Frontend: Add conditional action buttons
```

### Lessons for Future Feature Testing

**When User Reports "Backend Fixed"**:
1. **Verify specific endpoints** mentioned in request
2. **Test expected data structures** (EventType field, etc.)  
3. **Check for business logic implementation** (RSVP rules)
4. **Document gap between expectation and reality**
5. **Provide concrete next steps** for developers

**Quality Gates for Feature Testing**:
- ‚úÖ Infrastructure healthy (API responds)
- ‚ùå Feature endpoints available 
- ‚ùå Required data fields present
- ‚ùå Business logic implemented
- ‚ùå Frontend integration complete

### Integration with Previous Testing Knowledge

**Building on Established Patterns**:
- ‚úÖ File organization: 100% COMPLIANT (no violations)
- ‚úÖ Environment health checking: ALL services verified healthy
- ‚úÖ API connectivity testing: Proven reliable methodology
- **NEW**: Feature readiness assessment with gap analysis
- **NEW**: User expectation validation before testing
- **NEW**: Content-based inference when fields missing

## üö® MAJOR UPDATE: Events System Comprehensive Testing (2025-09-06)

### Critical Full-Stack Application Testing Pattern - SYSTEM GAPS IDENTIFICATION

**CRITICAL ACHIEVEMENT**: Successfully identified specific implementation gaps in the Events system through comprehensive end-to-end testing, distinguishing between working components and missing functionality.

**Test Execution Summary**:
- **Test Date**: 2025-09-06T16:30:00Z
- **Test Type**: Comprehensive Events System Validation
- **Tests Run**: 9 comprehensive tests across multiple routes and components
- **Results**: 6 PASSED, 3 FAILED - **60% system readiness**
- **Environment**: React (5174), API (5655), Docker healthy
- **Critical Discovery**: Backend API fully functional, frontend routing gaps identified

### System-Level Testing Methodology Success

**What Made This Testing Effective**:
1. **Router Analysis First** - Read router configuration to understand actual available routes
2. **API-First Validation** - Test backend endpoints independently of frontend
3. **Demo Page Validation** - Test working examples to understand system capabilities  
4. **Authentication Flow Testing** - Isolate auth issues from application functionality
5. **Evidence-Based Gap Analysis** - Screenshot proof of specific missing components

### Key Technical Discoveries

**‚úÖ FULLY FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS (100% Working)**:

1. **Backend Events API**:
   - URL: `http://localhost:5655/api/events`
   - Status: 200 OK, returns Array[4] events
   - Data Structure: {id, title, description, startDate, location}
   - Sample: "Introduction to Rope Bondage" - complete event details

2. **Admin Demo Pages**:
   - `/admin/events-management-api-demo` - Perfect API integration
   - `/admin/event-session-matrix-demo` - Complete form interface with TinyMCE
   - Both show live API data, proper styling, interactive elements

3. **Authentication UI**:
   - Login form properly constructed and styled
   - Form submission processes correctly
   - Clear error messaging system

**‚ùå MISSING/BROKEN COMPONENTS (Implementation Gaps)**:

1. **Public Events Route** - CRITICAL GAP:
   - Route `/events` returns 404 "No route matches URL '/events'"
   - Router has no entry for public events viewing
   - Impact: Users cannot view events publicly

2. **Authentication Credentials** - API Integration Issue:
   - Test account `admin@witchcityrope.com` returns HTTP 400
   - Login form works, API rejects credentials
   - Impact: Cannot access protected routes

3. **RSVP System** - Feature Gap:
   - No RSVP buttons or user registration functionality
   - No ticketing/registration workflow
   - Impact: Users cannot sign up for events

### Router Analysis Pattern (CRITICAL FOR COMPLEX APPS)

**Breakthrough Methodology**:
```typescript
// ALWAYS read router configuration FIRST before testing routes
// This prevents wasted time testing non-existent routes

// Example from router.tsx:
{ path: "admin/events-management-api-demo", element: <EventsManagementApiDemo /> } // ‚úÖ EXISTS
{ path: "dashboard/events", element: <EventsPage />, loader: authLoader }          // ‚úÖ EXISTS (protected)
// { path: "events", element: <PublicEventsPage /> }                              // ‚ùå MISSING
```

**Key Lesson**: Don't assume routes exist based on requirements. Verify actual router configuration first.

### API-First Testing Strategy Success

**Pattern That Worked**:
```javascript
// 1. Test API endpoints directly first
const eventsApiResponse = await page.request.get('http://localhost:5655/api/events');
// Result: API fully functional with 4 events

// 2. Then test UI integration  
await page.goto('/admin/events-management-api-demo');
// Result: Perfect API-UI integration in demo

// 3. Finally test missing user-facing routes
await page.goto('/events');
// Result: 404 - route doesn't exist (implementation gap identified)
```

**Advantage**: Separates backend functionality from frontend implementation issues.

### Authentication Testing Pattern

**Multi-Layer Authentication Validation**:
1. **UI Form Test**: Form fields exist, properly typed, submit button works
2. **API Request Test**: Form submission triggers API call  
3. **API Response Test**: HTTP 400 error (credential issue, not form issue)
4. **Error Display Test**: Error properly shown to user

**Result**: Precisely identified that auth UI works, API rejects credentials.

### Demo Page Validation Strategy

**Why Demo Pages Were Key**:
- Proved API integration patterns work
- Showed complete UI implementation examples
- Demonstrated system architecture is sound
- Provided implementation references for missing features

**Evidence**: 
- Events Management API Demo: Shows all 4 API events perfectly formatted
- Event Session Matrix Demo: Complete admin interface with working forms

### System Readiness Assessment Framework

**Quantitative Gap Analysis**:
```json
{
  "backendAPI": 100,        // Events API fully functional
  "demoPages": 100,         // Perfect working examples  
  "publicRoute": 0,         // Missing entirely
  "authentication": 40,     // Form works, credentials fail
  "rsvpSystem": 0,          // Not implemented
  "overallSystem": 60       // 60% ready
}
```

### Evidence Collection Standards

**Generated Comprehensive Documentation**:
1. **Visual Evidence**: Screenshots of working demos, error states, 404 pages
2. **Technical Evidence**: API response data, HTTP status codes, error messages
3. **Structured Reports**: JSON data for orchestrator decision-making
4. **Implementation Guides**: Specific gaps with development recommendations

### Implementation Gap Identification Success

**Priority 1 (Critical - Blocking Users)**:
- Missing `/events` route (1-2 days to implement)
- Authentication credential fix (1 day to debug)

**Priority 2 (High - Core Workflow)**:
- RSVP system implementation (2-3 days)
- Protected dashboard integration (1-2 days)

**Estimated Total**: 1-2 weeks for complete Events system

### Comprehensive E2E Testing Workflow

**Phase 1: Architecture Analysis**
```bash
# Read router configuration
find . -name "router.tsx" -exec cat {} \;

# Check available routes vs. requirements
```

**Phase 2: API Validation** 
```bash
# Test backend endpoints independently
curl http://localhost:5655/api/events
curl http://localhost:5655/health
```

**Phase 3: UI Component Testing**
```bash
# Test working routes first
# Then test expected missing routes
# Document gaps with evidence
```

**Phase 4: Integration Testing**
```bash
# Test API-UI integration in working examples
# Identify authentication flows
# Map user workflows end-to-end
```

**Phase 5: Gap Analysis & Reporting**
```bash
# Generate structured JSON report
# Create implementation roadmap
# Provide evidence artifacts
```

## üö® MAJOR UPDATE: File Organization Standards - PROJECT ROOT CLEANUP (2025-08-23)

### Critical File Organization Rules - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

**CRITICAL LESSON**: The test-executor agent MUST NEVER create files in the project root and MUST enforce proper file organization standards.

**Root Directory Cleanup Results**:
- **Files Moved**: 13 misplaced scripts and test files successfully organized
- **Duplicates Resolved**: 1 duplicate script properly handled
- **Architecture Compliance**: 100% - All files now follow standards
- **References Updated**: All documentation references verified correct

### Mandatory File Placement Rules

**Shell Scripts (.sh files)**:
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: `/scripts/` directory ONLY
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: Project root (causes clutter, violates architecture standards)
- **Exception**: `dev.sh` may remain in root for convenience (./dev.sh)

**Test Files**:
- ‚úÖ **JavaScript/Node tests**: `/tests/` directory
- ‚úÖ **HTML test designs**: `/docs/design/wireframes/` directory
- ‚úÖ **C# test projects**: `/tests/WitchCityRope.*.Tests/` directories
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: Project root or random subdirectories

**Utility Scripts**:
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: `/scripts/` directory
- **Examples**: take-screenshot.js, check-vulnerabilities.sh, etc.

### File Organization Validation Process

**MANDATORY Pre-Work Validation**:
```bash
# 1. Check for files in wrong locations
find /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v dev.sh

# 2. If ANY files found (except dev.sh), STOP and organize first
# 3. Report violation to orchestrator immediately

# 4. Proper organization commands:
# Scripts: mv script-name.sh scripts/
# Tests: mv test-file.js tests/ or mv test-file.html docs/design/wireframes/
# Utilities: mv utility.js scripts/
```

### Successful File Moves Completed (2025-08-23)

**Scripts Moved to `/scripts/`**:
1. ‚úÖ check-mcp-status.sh ‚Üí /scripts/check-mcp-status.sh
2. ‚úÖ check-vulnerabilities.sh ‚Üí /scripts/check-vulnerabilities.sh
3. ‚úÖ docker-dev.sh ‚Üí /scripts/docker-dev.sh (comprehensive version kept)
4. ‚úÖ docker-quick.sh ‚Üí /scripts/docker-quick.sh
5. ‚úÖ push-to-github.sh ‚Üí /scripts/push-to-github.sh
6. ‚úÖ run-performance-tests.sh ‚Üí /scripts/run-performance-tests.sh
7. ‚úÖ run.sh ‚Üí /scripts/run.sh
8. ‚úÖ run-tests-coverage.sh ‚Üí /scripts/run-tests-coverage.sh
9. ‚úÖ run-tests.sh ‚Üí /scripts/run-tests.sh
10. ‚úÖ start-docker.sh ‚Üí /scripts/start-docker.sh
11. ‚úÖ take-screenshot.js ‚Üí /scripts/take-screenshot.js

**Test Files Moved to Proper Locations**:
1. ‚úÖ test-form-designs.html ‚Üí /docs/design/wireframes/test-form-designs.html
2. ‚úÖ test-msw-setup.js ‚Üí /tests/test-msw-setup.js

**Files Kept in Root (Justified)**:
- ‚úÖ dev.sh ‚Üí Convenience quick-start script (./dev.sh)

### Duplicate Resolution Process

**docker-dev.sh Duplicate Handling**:
- **Root Version**: 256 lines, comprehensive interactive menu system
- **Scripts Version**: 249 lines, focused development starter
- **Resolution**: Kept comprehensive root version, renamed scripts version to `docker-dev-starter.sh`
- **Lesson**: Always compare functionality before choosing which duplicate to keep

### Reference Update Verification

**Documentation References Checked**:
- ‚úÖ `/docs/guides-setup/docker-operations-guide.md` - Already correctly referenced `/scripts/`
- ‚úÖ `package.json` scripts - No references to moved files
- ‚úÖ CI/CD workflows - No broken references found
- ‚úÖ Active documentation - All references correct

**Archives with Old References**:
- `/docs/_archive/` directories contain old references but are archived (acceptable)

### Testing Validation of Moved Files

**Script Functionality Verified**:
```bash
# All moved scripts remain executable and functional
chmod +x /scripts/*.sh
./scripts/run-tests.sh    # ‚úÖ WORKS - Successfully runs from new location
./scripts/docker-dev.sh   # ‚úÖ WORKS - Interactive menu functional
```

### Updated Test-Executor Pre-Work Checklist

**MANDATORY File Organization Check** (Add to Phase 1):
```bash
# 0. MANDATORY: File Organization Validation (NEW)
echo "üîç Checking file organization compliance..."

# Check for misplaced files in root
MISPLACED_FILES=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh" | wc -l)

if [ $MISPLACED_FILES -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION: $MISPLACED_FILES files found in project root"
    echo "üö´ STOPPING: Must organize files before testing"
    find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh"
    echo "üìã REQUIRED: Move files to appropriate directories:"
    echo "   Scripts (.sh): mv script.sh scripts/"
    echo "   Test files (.js): mv test.js tests/"
    echo "   HTML designs (.html): mv design.html docs/design/wireframes/"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ File organization compliance: PASSED"
```

### Architecture Standards Integration

**File Registry Requirement** (ALWAYS):
- ALL file movements MUST be logged in `/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`
- Include: Date, File Path, Action (MOVED), Purpose, New Location
- Status: ACTIVE for moved files, ARCHIVED for old locations

**Example Registry Entry**:
```markdown
| 2025-08-23 | check-mcp-status.sh | MOVED | MCP server status check script | FROM root TO /scripts/ | ACTIVE |
| 2025-08-23 | test-msw-setup.js | MOVED | MSW mock service testing utility | FROM root TO /tests/ | ACTIVE |
```

### Quality Gates for File Organization

**Green Light Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Zero files in project root (except dev.sh and standard files)
- ‚úÖ All scripts in `/scripts/` directory
- ‚úÖ All test files in appropriate test directories
- ‚úÖ All references updated and functional

**Red Light Indicators**:
- üî¥ Any .sh/.js/.html files in project root (except dev.sh)
- üî¥ Scripts mixed with source code
- üî¥ Test files in random locations
- üî¥ Broken references after file moves

### Integration with Testing Workflow

**Updated Pre-Testing Phase** (MANDATORY sequence):
1. **File Organization Check** (NEW - MANDATORY)
2. Docker Container Health Check
3. TypeScript Compilation Check
4. Service Health Verification
5. Database Seed Verification

**Critical Rule**: If file organization check fails, ALL testing STOPS until files are properly organized.

### Lessons for Future File Management

**Preventive Measures**:
1. **NEVER create files in root** - Always use appropriate subdirectories
2. **Check before creating** - Verify target directory exists and is correct
3. **Immediate organization** - Don't defer file organization to "later"
4. **Regular audits** - Include organization check in routine validations

**Recovery Protocol**:
1. **Identify violations** - Use find commands to locate misplaced files
2. **Categorize files** - Determine proper location for each file type
3. **Check for duplicates** - Compare functionality before moving
4. **Move systematically** - Scripts to /scripts/, tests to /tests/, etc.
5. **Update references** - Search and update any broken links
6. **Verify functionality** - Test that moved files still work
7. **Document changes** - Update file registry and lessons learned

### Success Criteria for File Organization

**Primary Objectives**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE SUCCESS**
- [x] All misplaced files identified and moved to proper locations
- [x] Duplicate files properly resolved (functionality preserved)
- [x] All references verified working after moves
- [x] File organization rules documented and integrated into workflow
- [x] Validation process created for future prevention

**Quality Gates**: ‚úÖ **ALL PASSED**
- [x] Zero architecture violations (clean project root)
- [x] All scripts functional from new locations
- [x] Documentation references accurate
- [x] Test files in appropriate directories
- [x] File registry updated with all moves

---

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Complete project root cleanup and establishment of mandatory file organization standards. The test-executor agent now has comprehensive rules and validation processes to prevent future architecture violations.

## E2E Testing Prerequisites - MANDATORY CHECKS

### üö® CRITICAL: ALWAYS CHECK DOCKER CONTAINER HEALTH FIRST üö®

**THIS IS SUPER COMMON AND MUST BE DONE EVERY TIME BEFORE E2E TESTS**

The #1 cause of E2E test failures is unhealthy Docker containers. The test-executor agent MUST verify the environment before attempting any E2E tests.

### Pre-Test Environment Validation Checklist

**0. MANDATORY: File Organization Check (NEW)**
```bash
# Check for misplaced files in project root
echo "üîç Validating file organization..."
MISPLACED_FILES=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh" | wc -l)

if [ $MISPLACED_FILES -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION: $MISPLACED_FILES files found in project root"
    echo "üö´ STOPPING: Must organize files before testing"
    find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh"
    echo "üìã REQUIRED: Move files to appropriate directories:"
    echo "   Scripts (.sh): mv script.sh scripts/"
    echo "   Test files (.js): mv test.js tests/"
    echo "   HTML designs (.html): mv design.html docs/design/wireframes/"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ File organization compliance: PASSED"
```

**1. Docker Container Status Check**
```bash
# Check all WitchCity containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Expected output: All containers should show "Up" status
# Name                State          Ports
# witchcityrope-web  Up            0.0.0.0:5173->3000/tcp
# witchcityrope-api  Up (healthy)  0.0.0.0:5655->8080/tcp
# witchcityrope-postgres Up (healthy) 0.0.0.0:5433->5432/tcp

# Quick health check
curl -f http://localhost:5173 && echo "‚úÖ React app ready"
curl -f http://localhost:5655/health && echo "‚úÖ API healthy"
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres && echo "‚úÖ Database ready"
```

**2. Container Health Status**
```bash
# Check specific health status for each service
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres -d witchcityrope_dev
curl -f http://localhost:5655/health
curl -f http://localhost:5173

# Check authentication system health
curl -f http://localhost:5655/api/auth/health

# Expected output: All commands should succeed without errors
```

**3. Check for Compilation Errors**
```bash
# UPDATED: More comprehensive compilation check including file organization
echo "üîç Checking file organization and compilation..."

# File organization check FIRST
MISPLACED=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh" | wc -l)
if [ $MISPLACED -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION: Files in wrong locations"
    exit 1
fi

# TypeScript compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Count and report any errors
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS"

# Check web service logs for compilation errors
docker-compose logs --tail 50 web | grep -i error

# Check API service logs for compilation errors  
docker-compose logs --tail 50 api | grep -i error

# Check for database connection issues
docker-compose logs --tail 50 api | grep -i "database\|postgres\|connection"

# If ANY compilation errors found, STOP and restart containers
docker-compose restart
```

**4. Service Health Endpoints**
```bash
# Verify web service responds
curl -f http://localhost:5651/health || echo "Web service unhealthy"

# Verify API service responds
curl -f http://localhost:5653/health || echo "API service unhealthy"

# Verify database connectivity
curl -f http://localhost:5653/health/database || echo "Database unhealthy"
```

### MANDATORY E2E Test Execution Flow

**The test-executor agent MUST follow this exact sequence:**

1. **File Organization Validation** (NEW - MANDATORY FIRST)
   - Check for files in project root
   - Ensure architecture compliance
   - Stop if violations found

2. **Environment Health Check** (MANDATORY)
   - Run all diagnostic commands above
   - Verify all containers healthy
   - Check for compilation errors
   - Test service endpoints

3. **Environment Fix If Needed**
   - If ANY issues found, restart with `./dev.sh`
   - Re-verify health after restart
   - Do NOT proceed until environment is 100% healthy

4. **Database Seed Verification**
   - Verify test accounts exist
   - Confirm seed data loaded

5. **ONLY THEN Proceed with E2E Tests**
   - Navigate to `/tests/playwright`
   - Run `npm test`
   - Monitor for environment-related failures

### Critical Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ File organization: 100% compliant (NEW)
- ‚úÖ All containers show "healthy" status
- ‚úÖ No compilation errors in logs
- ‚úÖ All health endpoints return 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Database seed data present
- ‚úÖ Services respond within 2 seconds

**Remember**: E2E tests are only as reliable as the environment they run in. Always verify file organization and environment health first!
