## üö® CRITICAL: WORKTREE COMPLIANCE - MANDATORY üö®

### ALL WORK MUST BE IN THE SPECIFIED WORKTREE DIRECTORY

**VIOLATION = CATASTROPHIC FAILURE**

When given a Working Directory like:
`/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/.worktrees/feature-2025-08-24-events-management`

**YOU MUST:**
- Write ALL files to paths within the worktree directory
- NEVER write to `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/` main repository
- ALWAYS use the full worktree path in file operations
- VERIFY you're in the correct directory before ANY file operation

**Example:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/.worktrees/feature-2025-08-24-events-management/docs/...`
- ‚ùå WRONG: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/...`

**Why This Matters:**
- Worktrees isolate feature branches
- Writing to main repo pollutes other branches
- Can cause merge conflicts and lost work
- BREAKS the entire development workflow

## Overview
Critical lessons learned for the test-executor agent, including mandatory E2E testing prerequisites, common failure patterns, file organization standards, and React component testing patterns.

## üö® MAJOR UPDATE: React Component Infinite Render Loop Detection (2025-09-06)

### Critical React Testing Pattern - INFINITE RENDER LOOP IDENTIFICATION

**CRITICAL ACHIEVEMENT**: Successfully identified and isolated a critical infinite render loop in NavigationTestPage component through comprehensive Playwright testing.

**Test Execution Summary**:
- **Test Date**: 2025-09-06T16:57:00Z
- **Test Type**: Page Stability Verification with Render Loop Detection
- **Tests Run**: 5 comprehensive page stability tests
- **Results**: 4 PASSED, 1 FAILED due to infinite render loop
- **Environment**: React healthy on port 5174, API unhealthy (not needed for React testing)
- **Critical Discovery**: NavigationTestPage.tsx has "Maximum update depth exceeded" error

### React Infinite Render Loop Detection Results

**Root Cause Identified**: `src/pages/NavigationTestPage.tsx:22:39`
**Error Pattern**: "Maximum update depth exceeded. This can happen when a component calls setState inside useEffect, but useEffect either doesn't have a dependency array, or one of the dependencies changes on every render."

**Technical Evidence**:
```javascript
// BROKEN PATTERN (causing infinite loop):
useEffect(() => {
  setRenderCount(renderCount + 1); // Updates state on every render
}); // Missing dependency array OR problematic dependency

// CORRECT PATTERNS:
useEffect(() => {
  setRenderCount(prev => prev + 1); // Use callback pattern
}, []); // Empty dependency array for one-time execution

// OR
useEffect(() => {
  setRenderCount(renderCount + 1);
}, [someSpecificDependency]); // Only update when dependency changes
```

### Playwright Effectiveness for React Component Testing

**Key Discovery**: Playwright is highly effective for detecting React component issues:

1. **Console Error Monitoring**: Successfully captured "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
2. **Test Timeout Patterns**: Test timeouts can indicate infinite loops (30-second timeout triggered)
3. **Page Load Monitoring**: Can track page reloads and rendering issues
4. **Screenshot Evidence**: Generated visual evidence of page states
5. **Performance Impact Detection**: Identified when components cause browser performance issues

### Critical Patterns for React Component Issue Detection

**Infinite Render Loop Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Console error: "Maximum update depth exceeded"
- ‚úÖ Test timeouts during screenshot/interaction attempts
- ‚úÖ Page becomes unresponsive
- ‚úÖ Excessive console error repetition
- ‚úÖ Browser performance degradation

**useEffect Anti-Patterns to Watch For**:
```javascript
// DANGEROUS PATTERN #1: Missing dependency array
useEffect(() => {
  setState(value); // Runs on every render
}); // Missing [] - causes infinite loop

// DANGEROUS PATTERN #2: State in dependency that changes every render
useEffect(() => {
  setState(count + 1);
}, [count]); // count changes ‚Üí useEffect runs ‚Üí count changes ‚Üí infinite loop

// DANGEROUS PATTERN #3: Object/array dependencies recreated on every render
const obj = { key: value }; // New object every render
useEffect(() => {
  doSomething(obj);
}, [obj]); // obj is new every time ‚Üí infinite loop
```

### Test Strategy for React Component Stability

**Phase 1: Environment Health (Mandatory)**
```bash
# File organization check FIRST
echo "üîç Validating file organization..."
MISPLACED=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh" | wc -l)
if [ $MISPLACED -gt 0 ]; then echo "‚ùå Architecture violation"; exit 1; fi

# React service health (API not required for React testing)
curl -f http://localhost:5174 && echo "‚úÖ React healthy"
```

**Phase 2: Console Error Monitoring (NEW - MANDATORY)**
```typescript
// Set up comprehensive console monitoring
page.on('console', msg => {
  if (msg.type() === 'error') {
    console.log(`‚ùå Console Error: ${msg.text()}`);
    if (msg.text().includes('Maximum update depth exceeded')) {
      throw new Error('INFINITE RENDER LOOP DETECTED');
    }
  }
});
```

**Phase 3: Page Stability Testing**
```typescript
// Monitor page for stability over time
await page.goto(url);
await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle', { timeout: 10000 });

// Wait and monitor for issues
await page.waitForTimeout(10000); // 10 second stability check

// If page becomes unresponsive or times out, suspect render loop
```

### React Component Testing Checklist

**Pre-Test Validation**:
- [x] File organization compliance check
- [x] React service health verification 
- [x] Console error monitoring setup
- [x] Page load timeout configuration

**During Test Execution**:
- [x] Monitor for "Maximum update depth exceeded" errors
- [x] Watch for test timeouts during basic operations
- [x] Track page responsiveness and performance
- [x] Capture screenshots for evidence

**Post-Test Analysis**:
- [x] Review console error patterns
- [x] Identify specific components causing issues
- [x] Provide exact file and line number for fixes
- [x] Generate comprehensive evidence for developers

### User Report Verification Methodology

**Approach**: Test what users report, but verify independently

**This Case Study**:
- **User Report**: "Demo page shows minimal content instead of full demo"
- **Test Result**: Demo page shows substantial content (68KB screenshot)
- **Conclusion**: User claim partially incorrect, may have different expectations

- **User Report**: "Navigation test page constantly counts up renders"  
- **Test Result**: CONFIRMED - Infinite render loop causing continuous re-renders
- **Conclusion**: User claim completely accurate

**Lesson**: Always test user reports objectively and provide evidence-based conclusions.

### Environment Issues vs Code Issues

**Environment Issues (Test-Executor Can Fix)**:
- Docker containers not running
- Database connections failed
- Port conflicts
- Service health problems
- **File organization violations** 

**Code Issues (Report to React Developer)**:
- Infinite render loops in useEffect
- Component state management issues
- React hook dependency problems
- Console errors from application code

**This Case Pattern**:
- ‚úÖ Environment: React service healthy - testing can proceed
- ‚ùå Code Issue: NavigationTestPage infinite render loop - report to react-developer
- ‚ùå Environment: API unhealthy - fixable but not needed for React testing

### Playwright Test Artifact Organization

## üö® MAJOR UPDATE: File Organization Standards - PROJECT ROOT CLEANUP (2025-08-23)

### Critical File Organization Rules - MANDATORY COMPLIANCE

**CRITICAL LESSON**: The test-executor agent MUST NEVER create files in the project root and MUST enforce proper file organization standards.

**Root Directory Cleanup Results**:
- **Files Moved**: 13 misplaced scripts and test files successfully organized
- **Duplicates Resolved**: 1 duplicate script properly handled
- **Architecture Compliance**: 100% - All files now follow standards
- **References Updated**: All documentation references verified correct

### Mandatory File Placement Rules

**Shell Scripts (.sh files)**:
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: `/scripts/` directory ONLY
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: Project root (causes clutter, violates architecture standards)
- **Exception**: `dev.sh` may remain in root for convenience (./dev.sh)

**Test Files**:
- ‚úÖ **JavaScript/Node tests**: `/tests/` directory
- ‚úÖ **HTML test designs**: `/docs/design/wireframes/` directory
- ‚úÖ **C# test projects**: `/tests/WitchCityRope.*.Tests/` directories
- ‚ùå **WRONG**: Project root or random subdirectories

**Utility Scripts**:
- ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: `/scripts/` directory
- **Examples**: take-screenshot.js, check-vulnerabilities.sh, etc.

### File Organization Validation Process

**MANDATORY Pre-Work Validation**:
```bash
# 1. Check for files in wrong locations
find /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v dev.sh

# 2. If ANY files found (except dev.sh), STOP and organize first
# 3. Report violation to orchestrator immediately

# 4. Proper organization commands:
# Scripts: mv script-name.sh scripts/
# Tests: mv test-file.js tests/ or mv test-file.html docs/design/wireframes/
# Utilities: mv utility.js scripts/
```

### Successful File Moves Completed (2025-08-23)

**Scripts Moved to `/scripts/`**:
1. ‚úÖ check-mcp-status.sh ‚Üí /scripts/check-mcp-status.sh
2. ‚úÖ check-vulnerabilities.sh ‚Üí /scripts/check-vulnerabilities.sh
3. ‚úÖ docker-dev.sh ‚Üí /scripts/docker-dev.sh (comprehensive version kept)
4. ‚úÖ docker-quick.sh ‚Üí /scripts/docker-quick.sh
5. ‚úÖ push-to-github.sh ‚Üí /scripts/push-to-github.sh
6. ‚úÖ run-performance-tests.sh ‚Üí /scripts/run-performance-tests.sh
7. ‚úÖ run.sh ‚Üí /scripts/run.sh
8. ‚úÖ run-tests-coverage.sh ‚Üí /scripts/run-tests-coverage.sh
9. ‚úÖ run-tests.sh ‚Üí /scripts/run-tests.sh
10. ‚úÖ start-docker.sh ‚Üí /scripts/start-docker.sh
11. ‚úÖ take-screenshot.js ‚Üí /scripts/take-screenshot.js

**Test Files Moved to Proper Locations**:
1. ‚úÖ test-form-designs.html ‚Üí /docs/design/wireframes/test-form-designs.html
2. ‚úÖ test-msw-setup.js ‚Üí /tests/test-msw-setup.js

**Files Kept in Root (Justified)**:
- ‚úÖ dev.sh ‚Üí Convenience quick-start script (./dev.sh)

### Duplicate Resolution Process

**docker-dev.sh Duplicate Handling**:
- **Root Version**: 256 lines, comprehensive interactive menu system
- **Scripts Version**: 249 lines, focused development starter
- **Resolution**: Kept comprehensive root version, renamed scripts version to `docker-dev-starter.sh`
- **Lesson**: Always compare functionality before choosing which duplicate to keep

### Reference Update Verification

**Documentation References Checked**:
- ‚úÖ `/docs/guides-setup/docker-operations-guide.md` - Already correctly referenced `/scripts/`
- ‚úÖ `package.json` scripts - No references to moved files
- ‚úÖ CI/CD workflows - No broken references found
- ‚úÖ Active documentation - All references correct

**Archives with Old References**:
- `/docs/_archive/` directories contain old references but are archived (acceptable)

### Testing Validation of Moved Files

**Script Functionality Verified**:
```bash
# All moved scripts remain executable and functional
chmod +x /scripts/*.sh
./scripts/run-tests.sh    # ‚úÖ WORKS - Successfully runs from new location
./scripts/docker-dev.sh   # ‚úÖ WORKS - Interactive menu functional
```

### Updated Test-Executor Pre-Work Checklist

**MANDATORY File Organization Check** (Add to Phase 1):
```bash
# 0. MANDATORY: File Organization Validation (NEW)
echo "üîç Checking file organization compliance..."

# Check for misplaced files in root
MISPLACED_FILES=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh" | wc -l)

if [ $MISPLACED_FILES -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION: $MISPLACED_FILES files found in project root"
    echo "üö´ STOPPING: Must organize files before testing"
    find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh"
    echo "üìã REQUIRED: Move files to appropriate directories:"
    echo "   Scripts (.sh): mv script.sh scripts/"
    echo "   Test files (.js): mv test.js tests/"
    echo "   HTML designs (.html): mv design.html docs/design/wireframes/"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ File organization compliance: PASSED"
```

### Architecture Standards Integration

**File Registry Requirement** (ALWAYS):
- ALL file movements MUST be logged in `/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`
- Include: Date, File Path, Action (MOVED), Purpose, New Location
- Status: ACTIVE for moved files, ARCHIVED for old locations

**Example Registry Entry**:
```markdown
| 2025-08-23 | check-mcp-status.sh | MOVED | MCP server status check script | FROM root TO /scripts/ | ACTIVE |
| 2025-08-23 | test-msw-setup.js | MOVED | MSW mock service testing utility | FROM root TO /tests/ | ACTIVE |
```

### Quality Gates for File Organization

**Green Light Indicators**:
- ‚úÖ Zero files in project root (except dev.sh and standard files)
- ‚úÖ All scripts in `/scripts/` directory
- ‚úÖ All test files in appropriate test directories
- ‚úÖ All references updated and functional

**Red Light Indicators**:
- üî¥ Any .sh/.js/.html files in project root (except dev.sh)
- üî¥ Scripts mixed with source code
- üî¥ Test files in random locations
- üî¥ Broken references after file moves

### Integration with Testing Workflow

**Updated Pre-Testing Phase** (MANDATORY sequence):
1. **File Organization Check** (NEW - MANDATORY)
2. Docker Container Health Check
3. TypeScript Compilation Check
4. Service Health Verification
5. Database Seed Verification

**Critical Rule**: If file organization check fails, ALL testing STOPS until files are properly organized.

### Lessons for Future File Management

**Preventive Measures**:
1. **NEVER create files in root** - Always use appropriate subdirectories
2. **Check before creating** - Verify target directory exists and is correct
3. **Immediate organization** - Don't defer file organization to "later"
4. **Regular audits** - Include organization check in routine validations

**Recovery Protocol**:
1. **Identify violations** - Use find commands to locate misplaced files
2. **Categorize files** - Determine proper location for each file type
3. **Check for duplicates** - Compare functionality before moving
4. **Move systematically** - Scripts to /scripts/, tests to /tests/, etc.
5. **Update references** - Search and update any broken links
6. **Verify functionality** - Test that moved files still work
7. **Document changes** - Update file registry and lessons learned

### Success Criteria for File Organization

**Primary Objectives**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE SUCCESS**
- [x] All misplaced files identified and moved to proper locations
- [x] Duplicate files properly resolved (functionality preserved)
- [x] All references verified working after moves
- [x] File organization rules documented and integrated into workflow
- [x] Validation process created for future prevention

**Quality Gates**: ‚úÖ **ALL PASSED**
- [x] Zero architecture violations (clean project root)
- [x] All scripts functional from new locations
- [x] Documentation references accurate
- [x] Test files in appropriate directories
- [x] File registry updated with all moves

---

**MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED**: Complete project root cleanup and establishment of mandatory file organization standards. The test-executor agent now has comprehensive rules and validation processes to prevent future architecture violations.

## E2E Testing Prerequisites - MANDATORY CHECKS

### üö® CRITICAL: ALWAYS CHECK DOCKER CONTAINER HEALTH FIRST üö®

**THIS IS SUPER COMMON AND MUST BE DONE EVERY TIME BEFORE E2E TESTS**

The #1 cause of E2E test failures is unhealthy Docker containers. The test-executor agent MUST verify the environment before attempting any E2E tests.

### Pre-Test Environment Validation Checklist

**0. MANDATORY: File Organization Check (NEW)**
```bash
# Check for misplaced files in project root
echo "üîç Validating file organization..."
MISPLACED_FILES=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh" | wc -l)

if [ $MISPLACED_FILES -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION: $MISPLACED_FILES files found in project root"
    echo "üö´ STOPPING: Must organize files before testing"
    find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh"
    echo "üìã REQUIRED: Move files to appropriate directories:"
    echo "   Scripts (.sh): mv script.sh scripts/"
    echo "   Test files (.js): mv test.js tests/"
    echo "   HTML designs (.html): mv design.html docs/design/wireframes/"
    exit 1
fi

echo "‚úÖ File organization compliance: PASSED"
```

**1. Docker Container Status Check**
```bash
# Check all WitchCity containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Expected output: All containers should show "Up" status
# Name                State          Ports
# witchcityrope-web  Up            0.0.0.0:5173->3000/tcp
# witchcityrope-api  Up (healthy)  0.0.0.0:5655->8080/tcp
# witchcityrope-postgres Up (healthy) 0.0.0.0:5433->5432/tcp

# Quick health check
curl -f http://localhost:5173 && echo "‚úÖ React app ready"
curl -f http://localhost:5655/health && echo "‚úÖ API healthy"
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres && echo "‚úÖ Database ready"
```

**2. Container Health Status**
```bash
# Check specific health status for each service
docker-compose exec postgres pg_isready -U postgres -d witchcityrope_dev
curl -f http://localhost:5655/health
curl -f http://localhost:5173

# Check authentication system health
curl -f http://localhost:5655/api/auth/health

# Expected output: All commands should succeed without errors
```

**3. Check for Compilation Errors**
```bash
# UPDATED: More comprehensive compilation check including file organization
echo "üîç Checking file organization and compilation..."

# File organization check FIRST
MISPLACED=$(find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.sh" -o -name "*.js" -o -name "*.html" | grep -v "./dev.sh" | wc -l)
if [ $MISPLACED -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "‚ùå ARCHITECTURE VIOLATION: Files in wrong locations"
    exit 1
fi

# TypeScript compilation check
npx tsc --noEmit

# Count and report any errors
npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | grep -c "error TS"

# Check web service logs for compilation errors
docker-compose logs --tail 50 web | grep -i error

# Check API service logs for compilation errors  
docker-compose logs --tail 50 api | grep -i error

# Check for database connection issues
docker-compose logs --tail 50 api | grep -i "database\|postgres\|connection"

# If ANY compilation errors found, STOP and restart containers
docker-compose restart
```

**4. Service Health Endpoints**
```bash
# Verify web service responds
curl -f http://localhost:5651/health || echo "Web service unhealthy"

# Verify API service responds
curl -f http://localhost:5653/health || echo "API service unhealthy"

# Verify database connectivity
curl -f http://localhost:5653/health/database || echo "Database unhealthy"
```

### MANDATORY E2E Test Execution Flow

**The test-executor agent MUST follow this exact sequence:**

1. **File Organization Validation** (NEW - MANDATORY FIRST)
   - Check for files in project root
   - Ensure architecture compliance
   - Stop if violations found

2. **Environment Health Check** (MANDATORY)
   - Run all diagnostic commands above
   - Verify all containers healthy
   - Check for compilation errors
   - Test service endpoints

3. **Environment Fix If Needed**
   - If ANY issues found, restart with `./dev.sh`
   - Re-verify health after restart
   - Do NOT proceed until environment is 100% healthy

4. **Database Seed Verification**
   - Verify test accounts exist
   - Confirm seed data loaded

5. **ONLY THEN Proceed with E2E Tests**
   - Navigate to `/tests/playwright`
   - Run `npm test`
   - Monitor for environment-related failures

### Critical Success Metrics

- ‚úÖ File organization: 100% compliant (NEW)
- ‚úÖ All containers show "healthy" status
- ‚úÖ No compilation errors in logs
- ‚úÖ All health endpoints return 200 OK
- ‚úÖ Database seed data present
- ‚úÖ Services respond within 2 seconds

**Remember**: E2E tests are only as reliable as the environment they run in. Always verify file organization and environment health first!
