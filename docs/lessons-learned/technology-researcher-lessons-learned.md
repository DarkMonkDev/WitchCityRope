# Technology Researcher Lessons Learned

## ðŸš¨ MANDATORY STARTUP PROCEDURE - READ FIRST ðŸš¨

### Critical Architecture Documents (MUST READ BEFORE ANY WORK):
1. **Migration Architecture**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/domain-layer-architecture.md`
2. **DTO Strategy**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/DTO-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md`
3. **Architecture Discovery Process**: `/docs/standards-processes/architecture-discovery-process.md`
4. **Migration Plan**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/migration-plan.md`

### Validation Gates (MUST COMPLETE):
- [ ] Read all architecture documents above
- [ ] Check if solution already exists
- [ ] Reference existing patterns in your work
- [ ] NEVER create manual DTO interfaces (use NSwag)

### Technology Researcher Specific Rules:
- **BEFORE researching alternatives, check if solution exists in architecture docs**
- **If work involves DTOs, APIs, or types â†’ Check NSwag implementation FIRST**
- **Document: 'Verified no existing solution in architecture docs: [list checked]'**
- **Research established patterns before suggesting new ones**

## Platform-Specific Evaluation Criteria

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Category**: Evaluation
**Severity**: Critical

### Context
Technology choices for WitchCityRope must consider unique platform requirements including safety, privacy, and community needs.

### What We Learned
- Safety and privacy requirements are non-negotiable constraints
- Mobile-first design affects technology selection significantly
- Community values should influence technology adoption decisions
- Resource constraints (volunteer development) affect maintenance burden considerations
- Authentication architecture (httpOnly cookies) limits certain technology options

### Action Items
- [ ] PRIORITIZE safety and privacy implications in all evaluations
- [ ] EVALUATE mobile experience impact for every technology choice
- [ ] CONSIDER long-term maintenance burden for volunteer development team
- [ ] ALIGN technology choices with community values and mission
- [ ] VALIDATE compatibility with httpOnly cookie authentication pattern

### Impact
Prevents technology choices that conflict with WitchCityRope's core requirements and constraints.

## Research Documentation Standards

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Category**: Documentation
**Severity**: High

### Context
Research documents must provide clear, actionable information for architecture decisions.

### What We Learned
- Executive summaries enable quick decision-making for stakeholders
- Structured comparison tables provide objective evaluation basis
- Implementation considerations prevent research-to-reality gaps
- Risk assessments enable proactive mitigation planning
- Source documentation enables verification and follow-up research

### Action Items
- [ ] INCLUDE executive summary with clear recommendation and confidence level
- [ ] CREATE structured comparison tables with weighted scoring
- [ ] DOCUMENT implementation path and integration considerations
- [ ] ASSESS risks with mitigation strategies for each recommendation
- [ ] REFERENCE all sources for verification and credibility

### Impact
Improves decision quality and reduces implementation risks through better documentation.

## UI Framework Issue Resolution Patterns

**Date**: 2025-08-18
**Category**: Technical Research
**Severity**: High

### Context
Successfully researched and solved complex Mantine v7 placeholder visibility issue using comprehensive multi-source research approach.

### What We Learned
- CSS-only solutions often outperform JavaScript state management for simple visual enhancements
- Mantine's Styles API provides powerful customization but requires understanding CSS specificity
- Focus-based CSS selectors (::placeholder, :focus, :focus-within) enable elegant conditional styling
- Browser compatibility testing is essential for CSS pseudo-element solutions
- Performance impact should be quantified (+200-400 bytes for CSS vs state management overhead)
- Implementation examples with actual code accelerate development adoption
- GitHub issues provide real-world developer experiences with specific problems
- Stack Overflow discussions reveal common workarounds and community solutions
- Multiple search term variations are needed to find comprehensive solutions

### Action Items
- [ ] RESEARCH existing solutions before creating custom implementations
- [ ] CHECK multiple information sources (GitHub, Stack Overflow, docs) for comprehensive understanding
- [ ] PRIORITIZE CSS-only solutions for visual enhancements when possible
- [ ] RESEARCH CSS specificity conflicts with UI framework internal styles
- [ ] PROVIDE working code examples in research recommendations
- [ ] QUANTIFY performance impact in measurable terms (bytes, runtime cost)
- [ ] VALIDATE solutions across all relevant input types and browsers
- [ ] CONSIDER framework-specific patterns when researching UI library issues

### Impact
Prevents reinventing solutions, ensures comprehensive coverage of technical requirements, and provides immediately actionable research outputs.

## Problem-Specific Research Strategy

**Date**: 2025-08-18
**Category**: Problem Solving
**Severity**: Critical

### Context
Researching specific technical issues requires targeted search strategies and multiple information sources to find comprehensive solutions.

### What We Learned
- GitHub issues provide real-world developer experiences with specific problems
- Official documentation may not cover edge cases or complex use scenarios
- WebFetch tool is invaluable for getting detailed information from documentation pages
- Community discussions (GitHub discussions, Reddit) offer practical insights
- Browser-specific behavior differences need to be considered for CSS solutions
- CSS specificity conflicts are common with UI frameworks and require framework-specific targeting

### Action Items
- [ ] SEARCH GitHub issues for reported problems and solutions first
- [ ] CHECK Stack Overflow for community workarounds and discussions
- [ ] USE multiple search term variations to capture different perspectives
- [ ] FETCH official documentation pages for detailed technical information
- [ ] EVALUATE browser compatibility for CSS-based solutions
- [ ] CONSIDER CSS specificity conflicts when recommending styling approaches
- [ ] DOCUMENT implementation code examples for immediate use
- [ ] ASSESS performance impact of different solution approaches

### Impact
Enables efficient problem resolution by leveraging existing community knowledge and avoiding reinvention of solutions.
