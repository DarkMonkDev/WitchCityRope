## Platform-Specific Evaluation Criteria

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Category**: Evaluation
**Severity**: Critical

### Context
Technology choices for WitchCityRope must consider unique platform requirements including safety, privacy, and community needs.

### What We Learned
- Safety and privacy requirements are non-negotiable constraints
- Mobile-first design affects technology selection significantly
- Community values should influence technology adoption decisions
- Resource constraints (volunteer development) affect maintenance burden considerations
- Authentication architecture (httpOnly cookies) limits certain technology options

### Action Items
- [ ] PRIORITIZE safety and privacy implications in all evaluations
- [ ] EVALUATE mobile experience impact for every technology choice
- [ ] CONSIDER long-term maintenance burden for volunteer development team
- [ ] ALIGN technology choices with community values and mission
- [ ] VALIDATE compatibility with httpOnly cookie authentication pattern

### Impact
Prevents technology choices that conflict with WitchCityRope's core requirements and constraints.

## UI Framework Issue Resolution Patterns

**Date**: 2025-08-18
**Category**: Technical Research
**Severity**: High

### Context
Successfully researched and solved complex Mantine v7 placeholder visibility issue using comprehensive multi-source research approach.

### What We Learned
- CSS-only solutions often outperform JavaScript state management for simple visual enhancements
- Mantine's Styles API provides powerful customization but requires understanding CSS specificity
- Focus-based CSS selectors (::placeholder, :focus, :focus-within) enable elegant conditional styling
- Browser compatibility testing is essential for CSS pseudo-element solutions
- Performance impact should be quantified (+200-400 bytes for CSS vs state management overhead)
- Implementation examples with actual code accelerate development adoption
- GitHub issues provide real-world developer experiences with specific problems
- Stack Overflow discussions reveal common workarounds and community solutions
- Multiple search term variations are needed to find comprehensive solutions

### Action Items
- [ ] RESEARCH existing solutions before creating custom implementations
- [ ] CHECK multiple information sources (GitHub, Stack Overflow, docs) for comprehensive understanding
- [ ] PRIORITIZE CSS-only solutions for visual enhancements when possible
- [ ] RESEARCH CSS specificity conflicts with UI framework internal styles
- [ ] PROVIDE working code examples in research recommendations
- [ ] QUANTIFY performance impact in measurable terms (bytes, runtime cost)
- [ ] VALIDATE solutions across all relevant input types and browsers
- [ ] CONSIDER framework-specific patterns when researching UI library issues

### Impact
Prevents reinventing solutions, ensures comprehensive coverage of technical requirements, and provides immediately actionable research outputs.

## Problem-Specific Research Strategy

**Date**: 2025-08-18
**Category**: Problem Solving
**Severity**: Critical

### Context
Researching specific technical issues requires targeted search strategies and multiple information sources to find comprehensive solutions.

### What We Learned
- GitHub issues provide real-world developer experiences with specific problems
- Official documentation may not cover edge cases or complex use scenarios
- WebFetch tool is invaluable for getting detailed information from documentation pages
- Community discussions (GitHub discussions, Reddit) offer practical insights
- Browser-specific behavior differences need to be considered for CSS solutions
- CSS specificity conflicts are common with UI frameworks and require framework-specific targeting

### Action Items
- [ ] SEARCH GitHub issues for reported problems and solutions first
- [ ] CHECK Stack Overflow for community workarounds and discussions
- [ ] USE multiple search term variations to capture different perspectives
- [ ] FETCH official documentation pages for detailed technical information
- [ ] EVALUATE browser compatibility for CSS-based solutions
- [ ] CONSIDER CSS specificity conflicts when recommending styling approaches
- [ ] DOCUMENT implementation code examples for immediate use
- [ ] ASSESS performance impact of different solution approaches

### Impact
Enables efficient problem resolution by leveraging existing community knowledge and avoiding reinvention of solutions.
