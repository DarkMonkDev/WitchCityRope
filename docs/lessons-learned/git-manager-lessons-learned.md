# Git Manager Agent Lessons Learned

## üö® CRITICAL: Git Worktree Workflow MANDATORY üö®

**All development MUST use git worktrees for session isolation**
- Branches in same directory = session conflicts
- Worktrees = complete isolation between parallel sessions
- MANDATORY cleanup after PR merge (Phase 5)

## üî¥ CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: Worktrees ARE Branches üî¥

**A worktree IS the branch - not a copy of a branch!**
- When you create a worktree, you're creating THE branch in its own directory
- The branch exists ONLY in the worktree directory
- There is NO separate branch that also exists elsewhere
- Removing the worktree removes the branch entirely

### ‚ùå WRONG Mental Model:
"Create a branch, then create a worktree from it" (NO! This is redundant!)

### ‚úÖ CORRECT Mental Model:
"Create a worktree AS the branch" (The worktree IS where the branch lives!)

## Worktree Management Procedures

### Worktree Creation (MANDATORY for all new work)
```bash
# This creates THE feature branch AS a worktree (not a copy!)
git worktree add ../witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description] -b feature/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description]
# The branch feature/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description] now exists ONLY in that worktree directory

# Setup environment IMMEDIATELY after creation
cd ../witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description]
cp ../../witchcityrope-react/.env .
npm install
```

### What Actually Happens When You Create a Worktree
1. **New branch is created**: `feature/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description]`
2. **Branch lives in worktree directory**: `../witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description]`
3. **Main repo stays on its current branch**: Usually `master` or `development`
4. **The worktree IS the branch**: Not a copy, not a duplicate - it IS the branch

### Environment Setup Checklist
- [ ] Copy .env file from main repository
- [ ] Run npm install for dependencies
- [ ] Verify database connection strings
- [ ] Check Docker configuration if needed
- [ ] Test basic functionality before delegation

### Worktree Status Monitoring
```bash
# List all active worktrees
git worktree list

# Check for stale worktrees (merged branches)
for wt in $(git worktree list --porcelain | grep "worktree" | cut -d' ' -f2); do
  branch=$(git -C "$wt" branch --show-current)
  if git branch --merged main | grep -q "$branch"; then
    echo "STALE: $wt (branch $branch is merged)"
  fi
done
```

### MANDATORY Phase 5 Cleanup
**Workflow CANNOT complete without cleanup verification**
```bash
# After PR merge confirmation
git worktree remove ../witchcityrope-worktrees/[feature-name]
rm -rf ../witchcityrope-worktrees/[feature-name]  # Ensure directory deleted
git worktree prune  # Clean up references
```

## Critical Rules

### NEVER create branches without worktrees
- Old way: `git checkout -b feature/name` ‚ùå
- New way: `git worktree add ../path -b feature/name` ‚úÖ

### ALWAYS verify worktree isolation
- Each worktree has separate working directory
- Changes in one worktree don't affect others
- Environment files are worktree-specific

### IMMEDIATE cleanup after merge
- Part of Phase 5 finalization (NOT scheduled)
- Prevents directory accumulation
- Maintains <3 active worktrees target

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Environment file not found in worktree
**Solution**: Always copy .env after worktree creation

### Issue: Dependencies missing in worktree
**Solution**: Run npm install in worktree directory

### Issue: Worktree directory accumulation
**Solution**: Enforce Phase 5 cleanup, never skip

### Issue: Can't remove worktree (uncommitted changes)
**Solution**: 
```bash
git -C [worktree-path] status  # Check changes
git -C [worktree-path] stash    # Stash if needed
git worktree remove [path]      # Now remove
```

## Worktree Naming Conventions

### Feature Development
`../witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description]`

### Bug Fixes
`../witchcityrope-worktrees/bugfix-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description]`

### Hotfixes
`../witchcityrope-worktrees/hotfix-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description]`

### Enhancement
`../witchcityrope-worktrees/enhancement-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[description]`

## Complete Workflow Example (CORRECT)

### Starting New Feature Work
```bash
# 1. Main repo stays on development branch (NEVER switches)
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
git branch --show-current  # Shows: development or master

# 2. Create feature branch AS a worktree (one command, one branch!)
git worktree add ../witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-2025-08-23-auth -b feature/2025-08-23-auth

# 3. The branch feature/2025-08-23-auth now exists ONLY in the worktree
# Main repo is STILL on development - unchanged!

# 4. Work happens in the worktree directory
cd ../witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-2025-08-23-auth
# Make changes, commit, push to GitHub

# 5. After PR merged, cleanup removes BOTH worktree AND branch
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
git worktree remove ../witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-2025-08-23-auth
# The branch is gone - it lived only in the worktree!
```

### What NOT to Do (WRONG)
```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG - Don't create a branch first
git checkout -b feature/auth  # NO! This switches branches in main repo
git worktree add ../worktrees/auth feature/auth  # NO! Redundant!

# ‚ùå WRONG - Don't switch branches in main repo
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
git checkout feature/something  # NO! Main repo should stay on development/master
```

## Migration from Branches

### For existing unmerged branches
```bash
# Create worktree from existing remote branch
git worktree add ../witchcityrope-worktrees/[branch-name] origin/[branch-name]
# This moves the branch to a worktree - it's no longer in the main repo

# Setup environment
cd ../witchcityrope-worktrees/[branch-name]
cp ../../witchcityrope-react/.env .
npm install
```

## Performance Considerations

### Disk Usage
- Each worktree only duplicates modified files
- Shared git objects between worktrees
- Target: <3 active worktrees to minimize disk usage

### Memory/CPU
- Each worktree can run separate dev servers
- Monitor port conflicts (use different ports)
- Consider resource limits with multiple environments

## Delegation Context Requirements

### ALWAYS provide worktree path to other agents
```
Working Directory: /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-[name]
```

### Verify agent acknowledgment of working directory
- Agents must confirm they're in correct worktree
- Check for environment file presence
- Validate dependencies installed

## Success Metrics

- Zero session conflicts between parallel Claude Code instances
- 100% cleanup success rate (no orphaned directories)
- <3 active worktrees maintained
- All agents working in correct isolation
