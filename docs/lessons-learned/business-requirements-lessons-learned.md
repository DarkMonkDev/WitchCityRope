# Business Requirements Lessons Learned

## Always Check File Existence Before Reading

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Category**: File Management
**Severity**: Critical

### Context
Attempting to read files that may not exist causes errors and breaks the workflow. Business requirements analysis often involves reading various documentation files that may or may not exist.

### What We Learned
- Always check if files exist before attempting to read them
- Use file discovery patterns to verify file presence
- Don't assume files exist based on naming conventions
- Handle file-not-found gracefully rather than failing

### Action Items
- [ ] Use LS or Glob to check file existence before Read operations
- [ ] Provide graceful fallbacks when expected files don't exist
- [ ] Document when files are expected vs optional in requirements analysis
- [ ] Create files only when explicitly required, never speculatively

### Impact
Prevents workflow failures and provides more robust requirements analysis process.

## Check Master Index Before Starting Requirements Work

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Category**: Process
**Severity**: Critical

### Context
Must check the functional area master index before starting new requirements work to avoid duplication and understand existing work.

### What We Learned
- Master index contains authoritative list of all functional areas
- Existing requirements may already cover requested functionality
- Current work status prevents conflicts with ongoing development
- Historical work provides essential context

### Action Items
- [ ] Always check `/docs/architecture/functional-area-master-index.md` first
- [ ] Identify existing functional areas with relevant requirements
- [ ] Review current work status to avoid conflicts
- [ ] Reference existing requirements when building on previous work

### Impact
Prevents duplicate work, ensures consistency, and builds on established patterns.

## Apply Domain-Specific Business Knowledge

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Category**: Analysis
**Severity**: High

### Context
WitchCityRope serves a specialized community with unique needs that must be understood for effective requirements analysis.

### What We Learned
- Rope bondage community has specific consent, safety, and privacy needs
- Event management requires specialized pricing models (sliding scale)
- Membership tiers significantly affect access patterns and requirements
- Community vetting processes are critical for trust and safety

### Action Items
- [ ] Consider safety and consent implications in all requirements
- [ ] Apply community-specific patterns for membership and access
- [ ] Reference existing successful platform patterns
- [ ] Leverage domain expertise rather than generic business analysis

### Impact
Ensures requirements align with community needs and leverage domain understanding for better solutions.

## Analyze All User Roles in Requirements

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Category**: Quality
**Severity**: High

### Context
Platform has distinct user roles (Admin, Teacher, Vetted Member, General Member, Guest) with different capabilities and needs.

### What We Learned
- Each user role has different access capabilities and restrictions
- Safety and privacy requirements differ significantly by role
- Business rules must account for role-based permissions
- Access patterns vary between role types

### Action Items
- [ ] Analyze impact on all user roles for every requirement
- [ ] Document role-specific business rules and restrictions
- [ ] Consider privacy implications for each role interaction
- [ ] Validate requirements against existing role permission patterns

### Impact
Ensures comprehensive requirements that work for all users and maintain appropriate access controls.

## Align Requirements with React Architecture

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Category**: Architecture
**Severity**: Medium

### Context
All requirements must be feasible within React + TypeScript frontend and .NET API backend architecture.

### What We Learned
- React component patterns influence UI requirements design
- API-driven architecture affects data flow requirements
- Authentication uses hybrid JWT + HttpOnly Cookies pattern
- Real-time features may require SignalR implementation

### Action Items
- [ ] Ensure UI requirements align with React component patterns
- [ ] Consider API design implications in data requirements
- [ ] Reference existing authentication patterns for security requirements
- [ ] Validate technical feasibility with development team when uncertain

### Impact
Ensures requirements can be implemented efficiently within existing technology stack.

## Use Structured Requirements Documentation

**Date**: 2025-08-19
**Category**: Documentation
**Severity**: Medium

### Context
Business requirements need consistent structure for effective communication with development teams and stakeholders.

### What We Learned
- Standardized format improves clarity and completeness
- User stories with acceptance criteria provide clear implementation guidance
- Business rules must be explicitly documented
- Success metrics are essential for validating implementation

### Action Items
- [ ] Use standardized business requirements template
- [ ] Include user stories with clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Document business rules explicitly
- [ ] Define measurable success metrics
- [ ] Provide examples and scenarios for complex requirements

### Impact
Improves communication clarity and reduces implementation ambiguity.
