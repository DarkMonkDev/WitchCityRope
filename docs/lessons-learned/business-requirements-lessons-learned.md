# Business Requirements Lessons Learned


## üö® MANDATORY STARTUP PROCEDURE - READ FIRST üö®

### Critical Architecture Documents (MUST READ BEFORE ANY WORK):
1. **Migration Architecture**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/domain-layer-architecture.md`
2. **DTO Strategy**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/DTO-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md`
3. **Architecture Discovery Process**: `/docs/standards-processes/architecture-discovery-process.md`
4. **Migration Plan**: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/migration-plan.md`

### Validation Gates (MUST COMPLETE):
- [ ] Read all architecture documents above
- [ ] Check if solution already exists
- [ ] Reference existing patterns in your work
- [ ] NEVER create manual DTO interfaces (use NSwag)

### Business Requirements Agent Specific Rules:
- **BEFORE creating ANY technical requirements, complete Architecture Discovery Phase**
- **If work involves DTOs, APIs, or types ‚Üí Check domain-layer-architecture.md FIRST**

## üö® MANDATORY: Agent Handoff Documentation Process üö®

**CRITICAL**: This is NOT optional - handoff documentation is REQUIRED for workflow continuity.

### üìã WHEN TO CREATE HANDOFF DOCUMENTS
- **END of requirements phase** - BEFORE design begins
- **COMPLETION of user stories** - Document critical business rules
- **DISCOVERY of constraints** - Share immediately
- **STAKEHOLDER DECISIONS** - Document all approvals and changes

### üìÅ WHERE TO SAVE HANDOFFS
**Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/handoffs/`
**Naming**: `business-requirements-YYYY-MM-DD-handoff.md`
**Template**: `/docs/standards-processes/agent-handoff-template.md`

### üìù WHAT TO INCLUDE (TOP 5 CRITICAL)
1. **Business Rules**: Critical rules that MUST be implemented
2. **User Stories**: Complete stories with acceptance criteria
3. **Stakeholder Decisions**: Approved requirements and changes
4. **Constraints**: Technical and business limitations discovered
5. **Success Criteria**: How to validate implementation

### ü§ù WHO NEEDS YOUR HANDOFFS
- **UI Designers**: User flow and interaction requirements
- **Functional Spec Agents**: Business rules for technical specs
- **Backend Developers**: Domain logic and validation rules
- **Test Developers**: Acceptance criteria for test cases

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY READING BEFORE STARTING
**ALWAYS READ EXISTING HANDOFFS FIRST**:
1. Check `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/handoffs/` for previous work
2. Read ALL handoff documents in the functional area
3. Understand business context already established
4. Build on existing requirements - don't contradict decisions

### üö® FAILURE TO CREATE HANDOFFS = IMPLEMENTATION FAILURES
**Why this matters**:
- Design will miss critical business rules
- Implementation will violate requirements
- Test cases won't cover acceptance criteria
- Features will need complete rework

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: Create handoff documents or workflow WILL fail.
- **Document: 'Verified no existing solution in: [docs checked]'**
- **NEVER specify manual DTO creation - all types come from NSwag auto-generation**

## üö® CRITICAL: DTO Specification Requirements (READ FIRST) üö®
**Date**: 2025-08-19
**Category**: Requirements Documentation
**Severity**: Critical

### Context
Business requirements must specify exact data structure requirements to prevent DTO/interface mismatches during implementation.

### What We Learned
- **NSwag Auto-Generation Workflow**: Requirements drive C# DTOs which auto-generate TypeScript types
- **OpenAPI Documentation Critical**: Well-documented DTOs in requirements ensure perfect generated types
- **No Frontend Type Specifications**: Requirements specify business needs - NSwag handles TypeScript
- **DTO Changes Auto-Propagate**: C# DTO modifications automatically update frontend via generation
- **Business Logic vs Data Transfer**: Requirements must separate business rules from API data contracts
- **Change Management**: Breaking DTO changes require 30-day notice for frontend coordination

### Action Items
- [ ] READ: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/DTO-ALIGNMENT-STRATEGY.md` (updated with NSwag emphasis)
- [ ] READ: `/docs/architecture/react-migration/domain-layer-architecture.md` for NSwag workflow
- [ ] SPECIFY: Business data needs - let NSwag handle TypeScript generation
- [ ] DOCUMENT: OpenAPI annotation requirements for comprehensive type generation
- [ ] REFERENCE: Existing C# DTOs in packages/contracts/ before new specifications
- [ ] COORDINATE: DTO changes with 30-day frontend notice requirement

### Requirements Documentation Standards
```markdown
## Data Structure Requirements

### User Profile Data
- sceneName: string (required, 3-50 characters)
- createdAt: DateTime (required, ISO 8601 format)
- lastLoginAt: DateTime? (optional, can be null)
- roles: List<string> (required, from predefined role enum)
- isVetted: boolean (required, default: false)
- membershipLevel: string (required, from membership enum)

### Business Rules
- sceneName must be unique across platform
- lastLoginAt updates on each successful authentication
- roles array cannot be empty for authenticated users

# Business Requirements Lessons Learned

## Always Check File Existence Before Reading

**Date**: 2025-08-17
**Category**: File Management
**Severity**: Critical

### Context
Attempting to read files that may not exist causes errors and breaks the workflow. Business requirements analysis often involves reading various documentation files that may or may not exist.

### What We Learned
- Always check if files exist before attempting to read them
- Use file discovery patterns to verify file presence
- Don't assume files exist based on naming conventions
- Handle file-not-found gracefully rather than failing

### Action Items
- [ ] Use LS or Glob to check file existence before Read operations
- [ ] Provide graceful fallbacks when expected files don't exist
- [ ] Document when files are expected vs optional in requirements analysis
- [ ] Create files only when explicitly required, never speculatively

### Impact
Prevents workflow failures and provides more robust requirements analysis process.
