# Authentication Documentation Consolidation Archive
<!-- Archived: 2025-08-04 -->

## Summary
This archive contains the original authentication documentation files that were consolidated into the new structured format at `/docs/functional-areas/authentication/`.

## What Was Consolidated
- 19+ authentication-related documents
- Multiple login test reports with overlapping information
- Outdated implementation guides
- Historical migration documentation

## Consolidation Results
Created single source of truth documents:
- `current-state/business-requirements.md` - Current business rules and user capabilities
- `current-state/functional-design.md` - Technical implementation with critical Blazor Server pattern
- `current-state/user-flows.md` - Current user interaction patterns
- `current-state/test-coverage.md` - All authentication tests
- `current-state/wireframes.md` - UI specifications
- `development-history.md` - Major milestones and decisions

## Key Information Preserved
1. **Critical Discovery**: SignInManager cannot be used in Blazor components (causes "Headers are read-only" error)
2. **Solution Pattern**: Blazor components must redirect to Razor Pages for auth operations
3. **Current State**: Cookie auth for web, JWT for API
4. **Not Implemented**: 2FA, OAuth, password reset, email verification enforcement
