## Issues Fixed During This Session

### 1. ‚úÖ System.Text.Json Security Vulnerability (GHSA-8g4q-xg66-9fp4)
- **Issue**: System.Text.Json 6.0.0 had a high severity vulnerability
- **Fix**: Updated to version 9.0.0 in WitchCityRope.PerformanceTests project
- **Status**: **RESOLVED**

### 2. ‚úÖ Bogus Package Dependency
- **Issue**: Tests.Common project couldn't find Bogus.dll at runtime
- **Fix**: Rebuilt project with proper package restoration
- **Status**: **RESOLVED**

### 3. ‚úÖ API Test Package Version Conflicts
- **Issue**: Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.Abstractions version mismatch (9.0.0 vs 9.0.6)
- **Fix**: Added explicit package reference to version 9.0.6
- **Status**: **RESOLVED**

### 4. ‚úÖ E2E Test Missing Types
- **Issue**: TestUser and TestEvent types not found
- **Fix**: Added missing using directive (types already existed)
- **Status**: **RESOLVED**

### 5. ‚úÖ Performance Test Enum Parsing
- **Issue**: "Requested value 'Json' was not found" when parsing ReportFormat enum
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed unsupported 'Json' format from configuration
  - Added case-insensitive parsing with error handling
  - Updated appsettings.json to use only valid formats
- **Status**: **RESOLVED**

## Remaining Issues

### High Priority üî¥

1. **PostgreSQL Database Connection**
   - Infrastructure tests failing due to missing PostgreSQL instance
   - Need to either:
     - Start PostgreSQL container for tests
     - Configure in-memory database for unit tests
     - Set up test-specific connection strings

2. **Integration Test Server Startup**
   - Tests cannot start the test server properly
   - Likely missing configuration or services
   - Authentication and navigation tests all failing

3. **Performance Test Server**
   - Tests require running API on https://localhost:5652
   - No server instance available during test run

### Medium Priority üü°

1. **Web Test Build Errors**
   - Package downgrade warnings treated as errors
   - xUnit version conflicts (2.7.0 vs 2.6.5)
   - Security vulnerabilities in System.Net.Http

2. **Nullable Reference Warnings**
   - 95 warnings throughout the codebase
   - Mostly in Core entities
   - Should be addressed for code quality

## Test Categories Analysis

### ‚úÖ Core Tests (100% Passing)
Excellent coverage of:
- Value Objects (EmailAddress, SceneName, Money)
- Entities (User, Event, Registration, IncidentReport)
- Domain Services
- Business logic validation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Infrastructure Tests (63% Passing)
Failures in:
- **Database Tests** (31 failures) - PostgreSQL connection issues
- **Email Service** (3 failures) - Mock configuration
- **JWT Service** (2 failures) - Configuration issues
- **PayPal Service** (3 failures) - Mock setup

### ‚ùå Performance Tests (0% Passing)
- Enum parsing issue **FIXED**
- Still failing due to no server running
- Tests designed for load testing with NBomber

### ‚ùå Integration Tests (22% Passing)
Major issues:
- Test server won't start
- Authentication flow broken
- Navigation tests failing
- Database initialization problems

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Start PostgreSQL Container**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d
   ```

2. **Fix Web Test Package Conflicts**
   - Update all test projects to xUnit 2.7.0
   - Update security-vulnerable packages

3. **Configure Test Database**
   - Add test-specific appsettings.Test.json
   - Use in-memory database for unit tests
   - Real PostgreSQL for integration tests

### For CI/CD Pipeline
1. **Use Core Tests as Primary Gate** - 100% passing, stable
2. **Fix Infrastructure Tests** before including in CI
3. **Run Performance Tests separately** - require full environment

### Code Quality
1. Address nullable reference warnings
2. Add XML documentation to reduce warnings
3. Consider enabling nullable reference types project-wide

## Conclusion

The project is in a healthy state with core business logic fully tested and passing. The main issues are infrastructure-related (database connections, test server configuration) rather than business logic problems. With the fixes applied today, the codebase is more secure and several blocking issues have been resolved.

**Next Steps**:
1. Set up PostgreSQL for tests
2. Fix remaining package conflicts
3. Configure integration test server
4. Run full test suite with proper infrastructure
