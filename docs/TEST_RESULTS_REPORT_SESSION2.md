## Summary of Progress

### Session 1 ‚Üí Session 2 Improvements

| Test Suite | Session 1 | Session 2 | Change |
|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Unit Tests | 98.05% | 100% (Core) | +1.95% |
| Integration | 46.5% | 46.5% | No change |
| E2E Tests | 65-70% | TBD (partial run) | In progress |

### Major Wins üéâ
1. All critical infrastructure issues resolved
2. Unit tests at 100% for Core project
3. Database and HTTPS issues completely fixed
4. UI elements now properly rendering
5. Admin page performance significantly improved

### Still Blocked üöß
1. **Integration tests** - Application-level issues:
   - Missing routes and controllers
   - Wrong HTTP status codes
   - Authentication middleware configuration
2. **E2E tests** - Some pages still timing out despite optimizations

## Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. Implement missing controllers/endpoints (causing 404s)
2. Fix authentication middleware to allow public access
3. Update API to return correct HTTP status codes
4. Fix remaining admin page timeouts

### Medium Priority
1. Update Web tests to use ComponentTestBase
2. Fix protected route access control
3. Address missing static resources (404s)
4. Complete visual regression baseline generation

### Low Priority
1. Optimize test performance further
2. Add test retry logic
3. Configure test parallelization
4. Create GitHub issues for tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Focus on Integration Tests** - The 46.5% pass rate needs improvement
   - Implement missing endpoints
   - Fix routing configuration
   - Correct HTTP status codes
2. **Complete E2E Test Run** - Run full suite to measure overall improvement
3. **Address Remaining Timeouts** - Some admin pages still timing out
4. **Document Fixes** - Update developer documentation with lessons learned
