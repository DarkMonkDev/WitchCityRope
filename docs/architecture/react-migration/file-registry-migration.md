# File Registry Migration Strategy for React Repository

<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-14 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Architecture Team -->
<!-- Status: Active -->

## Overview

This document defines the strategy for migrating the file registry system from the Blazor Server repository to the React repository while preserving the complete audit trail and maintaining file lifecycle management standards.

**CRITICAL**: The file registry is essential for preventing orphaned files and maintaining project cleanliness. The migration must preserve all historical data while establishing a clean foundation for React development.

## Current File Registry Analysis

### Registry Statistics
Based on `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`:
- **Total Entries**: 142 tracked files
- **Date Range**: 2025-01-20 to 2025-08-14
- **Categories**: Documentation, code files, tests, configurations
- **Status Types**: PERMANENT (majority), ARCHIVED, TEMPORARY, DELETED

### Registry Structure
```markdown
| Date | File Path | Action | Purpose | Session/Task | Status | Cleanup Date |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | /full/path/to/file | CREATED/MODIFIED/DELETED | Why this file exists | Task description | ACTIVE/ARCHIVED/TEMPORARY | When to review |
```

### Key Insights from Current Registry
- **File Creation Patterns**: Heavy documentation creation during consolidation phases
- **Cleanup Discipline**: Regular cleanup of temporary files
- **Session Tracking**: Clear session-based file organization
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper status tracking and cleanup dates

## Migration Strategy Overview

### Three-Phase Approach

#### Phase 1: Archive Migration (Day 1)
- Export complete registry from Blazor repository
- Mark all entries as "MIGRATED_FROM_BLAZOR"
- Preserve in archive section for reference

#### Phase 2: New Registry Establishment (Day 1)  
- Start fresh registry for React repository
- Implement same standards and format
- Begin with migration documentation entries

#### Phase 3: Operational Continuity (Ongoing)
- Maintain same file tracking standards
- Continue session-based organization
- Preserve audit trail requirements

## Detailed Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Historical Archive Creation

#### Export Process
1. **Copy Complete Registry**: Preserve all 142 entries exactly as-is
2. **Archive Section Creation**: Add archive header in new registry
3. **Migration Markers**: Clear separation between old and new

#### Archive Format
```markdown
# File Registry - WitchCityRope React Repository

## HISTORICAL ARCHIVE: Blazor Server Repository
<!-- Migrated from /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/ on 2025-08-14 -->
<!-- Contains complete audit trail from 2025-01-20 to 2025-08-14 -->
<!-- Total entries: 142 files tracked -->

### Archive Header
**Repository**: WitchCityRope Blazor Server (archived)
**Migration Date**: 2025-08-14
**Total Archived Entries**: 142
**Date Range**: 2025-01-20 to 2025-08-14
**Archive Purpose**: Preserve complete file tracking history for reference

### Archived Registry Entries
| Date | File Path | Action | Purpose | Session/Task | Status | Archive Note |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| [BLAZOR ARCHIVE START] | Repository migration marker | ARCHIVE | Complete Blazor repository file history | React migration | ARCHIVED | Historical reference |
| 2025-08-14 | /docs/architecture/react-migration/documentation-migration-strategy.md | CREATED | Comprehensive strategy for migrating documentation system | React migration planning | ARCHIVED | Migrated to React repo |
| 2025-08-14 | /docs/architecture/react-migration/api-layer-analysis.md | CREATED | API layer analysis for React migration | React migration planning | ARCHIVED | Analysis complete |
... [Continue with all 142 entries] ...
| 2025-01-20 | /docs/architecture/file-registry.md | CREATED | Central tracking of all file operations | File lifecycle management | ARCHIVED | System established |
| [BLAZOR ARCHIVE END] | Repository migration marker | ARCHIVE | End of Blazor repository file history | React migration | ARCHIVED | Historical reference |
```

### Phase 2: New Registry Establishment

#### Fresh Start Format
```markdown
## ACTIVE FILE REGISTRY: React Repository
<!-- Started: 2025-08-14 -->
<!-- Repository: WitchCityRope-React -->
<!-- Entry numbering starts at 200 for clear separation -->

### Registry Standards
All files created, modified, or deleted in the React repository MUST be logged here.

**Required for EVERY file operation**:
| Date | File Path | Action | Purpose | Session/Task | Status | Cleanup Date |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | /full/path/to/file | CREATED/MODIFIED/DELETED | Why this file exists | Task description | ACTIVE/ARCHIVED/TEMPORARY | When to review |

### Active Registry Entries
| Date | File Path | Action | Purpose | Session/Task | Status | Cleanup Date |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|--------------|--------|--------------|
| 2025-08-14 | [REACT REPOSITORY START] | SYSTEM | Beginning of React repository file tracking | Repository migration | PERMANENT | N/A |
| 2025-08-14 | /docs/architecture/file-registry.md | CREATED | File tracking system for React repository | Repository setup | PERMANENT | N/A |
| 2025-08-14 | /.claude/CLAUDE.md | CREATED | Claude Code configuration for React | Repository setup | PERMANENT | N/A |
| 2025-08-14 | /.claude/agents/react-developer.md | CREATED | React development specialist agent | Repository setup | PERMANENT | N/A |
| 2025-08-14 | /docs/00-START-HERE.md | CREATED | Navigation guide for React repository | Repository setup | PERMANENT | N/A |
```

### Phase 3: Operational Standards

#### File Tracking Rules (Preserved)
1. ❌ **NEVER** create files in the root directory
2. ✅ **ALWAYS** log in `/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`
3. ✅ **USE** `/session-work/YYYY-MM-DD/` for temporary files
4. ✅ **NAME** files descriptively with context
5. ✅ **REVIEW** and clean up files at session end

#### Status Types (Preserved)
- **PERMANENT**: Core project files that should remain indefinitely
- **ACTIVE**: Currently being worked on or recently created
- **ARCHIVED**: Moved to `_archive` directories for reference
- **TEMPORARY**: Session-specific files with planned cleanup dates
- **DELETED**: Files removed from the project

#### Session Work Structure (Preserved)
```
session-work/
├── 2025-08-14/               # Repository setup session
├── 2025-08-15/               # First development session
├── 2025-08-16/               # Continuing sessions
└── YYYY-MM-DD/               # Date-organized sessions
```

## Migration Implementation

### Day 1 Hour 1: Registry Migration
```bash
# 1. Create React repository structure
mkdir -p WitchCityRope-React/docs/architecture
mkdir -p WitchCityRope-React/session-work/2025-08-14

# 2. Create file registry with archive
# Copy current registry content to archive section
# Add new registry section below archive

# 3. Log migration as first entry
echo "2025-08-14 | [REACT REPOSITORY START] | SYSTEM | Beginning of React repository file tracking | Repository migration | PERMANENT | N/A" >> file-registry.md
```

### Day 1 Hour 2: Standards Transfer
```bash
# 1. Copy file registry standards
# 2. Update CLAUDE.md with file tracking requirements
# 3. Ensure session-work structure created
# 4. Test logging process with sample entries
```

### Day 1 Hour 3: Validation
```bash
# 1. Verify archive section preserves all history
# 2. Test new entry logging process
# 3. Confirm session work directory structure
# 4. Validate cleanup procedures
```

## File Lifecycle Management

### Session Work Organization
**Structure Preserved**:
```
session-work/
├── 2025-08-14-repository-setup/
│   ├── migration-notes.md
│   ├── setup-checklist.md
│   └── validation-results.md
├── 2025-08-15-first-component/
│   ├── component-analysis.md
│   ├── implementation-notes.md
│   └── testing-strategy.md
└── YYYY-MM-DD-session-description/
    ├── temporary-files
    └── session-artifacts
```

### Cleanup Procedures (Preserved)
```markdown
## End of Session Checklist
- [ ] All files created/modified during session are logged in registry
- [ ] Session-specific temporary files moved to `/session-work/YYYY-MM-DD/`
- [ ] Final status updated for all files (PERMANENT/ARCHIVED/TEMPORARY)
- [ ] Any files marked as TEMPORARY have cleanup dates set
- [ ] Files that should be permanent are committed to git
```

### Audit Trail Preservation
```markdown
## Registry Audit Standards

### Entry Requirements
Every entry MUST include:
- **Date**: When file was created/modified/deleted
- **File Path**: Complete absolute path
- **Action**: CREATED/MODIFIED/DELETED/MOVED
- **Purpose**: Why the file exists and what it does
- **Session/Task**: Context of when it was created
- **Status**: Current lifecycle state
- **Cleanup Date**: When to review (for TEMPORARY files)

### Quality Standards
- **Descriptive Names**: authentication-analysis-2025-08-15.md NOT status.md
- **Clear Purpose**: Specific reason for file existence
- **Session Context**: Link to broader work context
- **Lifecycle Tracking**: Status changes over time
```

## Integration with Claude Code

### Automated Logging Integration
The file registry integrates with Claude Code configuration:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md Section Update
## 📁 MANDATORY FILE TRACKING

### ALL Files Created/Modified/Deleted MUST Be Logged!

**CRITICAL**: Every file you create, modify, or delete MUST be logged in the [File Registry](/docs/architecture/file-registry.md).

**React Repository**: Continue same standards with React-specific context
**Entry Format**: Preserve exact format and requirements
**Session Work**: Maintain `/session-work/YYYY-MM-DD/` structure
**Cleanup**: Same end-of-session procedures
```

### Agent Integration
All agents must be updated to reference file registry:

```markdown
# Example Agent Update
## File Lifecycle Compliance
- MUST log all file operations in /docs/architecture/file-registry.md
- MUST use descriptive file names with context
- MUST place temporary files in /session-work/YYYY-MM-DD/
- MUST update file status appropriately
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Loss Prevention
- **Complete Archive**: Full history preserved in archive section
- **Backup Strategy**: Git repository maintains all changes
- **Validation Process**: Multi-step verification of migration
- **Rollback Plan**: Can revert to Blazor registry if needed

### Process Continuity
- **Standards Preservation**: Exact same file tracking rules
