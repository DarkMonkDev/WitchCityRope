## Testing Strategy

### Agent Individual Testing
Each agent must be tested for:
- [ ] **Startup procedure** - Reads correct lessons learned
- [ ] **Tool usage** - Appropriate tools available
- [ ] **File restrictions** - Cannot touch forbidden files
- [ ] **Pattern recognition** - Recognizes React/TypeScript files
- [ ] **Quality standards** - Follows React best practices

### Agent Integration Testing
Test agent coordination:
- [ ] **Orchestrator delegation** - Routes work to correct agents
- [ ] **Human review gates** - Pauses for approval appropriately
- [ ] **File boundary enforcement** - Agents respect file restrictions
- [ ] **Workflow progression** - Phases complete correctly

### Workflow Testing
Test complete workflows:
- [ ] **New React component** - Full development lifecycle
- [ ] **API integration** - Backend + frontend coordination
- [ ] **Testing workflow** - Test creation and execution
- [ ] **Bug fixing** - Issue identification and resolution

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Items
- [ ] **orchestrator.md** - Critical for all workflows (test immediately)
- [ ] **react-developer.md** - Essential for development (test Day 1)
- [ ] **test-executor.md** - Required for testing (test Day 1)

### Medium Risk Items
- [ ] **Agent delegation logic** - File pattern matching
- [ ] **Human review gates** - Approval process preservation
- [ ] **Tool restrictions** - Agent boundary enforcement

### Low Risk Items
- [ ] **Documentation agents** - librarian.md updates
- [ ] **Design agents** - ui-designer.md updates
- [ ] **Planning agents** - business-requirements.md (minimal changes)

## Success Criteria

### Day 1 Success
- [ ] Orchestrator responds to trigger words
- [ ] Basic React development workflow functional
- [ ] File registry tracking operational
- [ ] Human review gates preserved

### Day 2 Success
- [ ] Complete development workflow operational
- [ ] All agent delegation working correctly
- [ ] Testing workflow functional
- [ ] Code review process working

### Day 3 Success
- [ ] Advanced React patterns supported
- [ ] State management workflow operational
- [ ] UI design workflow functional
- [ ] Performance optimization patterns available

## Rollback Plan

If critical agents fail:
1. **Preserve working agents** from Blazor repository
2. **Update gradually** one agent at a time
3. **Test each update** before proceeding
4. **Maintain fallback versions** of critical agents

## Conclusion

This migration checklist ensures systematic migration of all AI agents while preserving workflow functionality and adding React-specific capabilities. The phased approach minimizes risk while enabling rapid development velocity in the React repository.

**Priority Focus**:
1. **Day 1**: Core orchestration and basic React development
2. **Day 2**: Complete development workflow
3. **Day 3**: Advanced patterns and optimization

Success depends on thorough testing at each phase and preservation of the sophisticated workflow orchestration that makes the AI system effective.
