## üéØ Executive Summary

**Why This Migration**: WitchCityRope needs to transition from Blazor Server to React to achieve better developer experience, performance, scalability, and maintainability. The current Blazor Server architecture, while functional, has become a bottleneck for rapid feature development and modern UX requirements.

**Strategic Approach**: **Hybrid Approach with Selective Porting to New Repository**  
- Create entirely new WitchCityRope-React repository
- Port 95% of API layer directly (minimal Blazor dependencies found)
- Rebuild all UI components in modern React patterns
- Migrate complete documentation and AI workflow systems
- Maintain parallel development capability

**Expected Outcomes**:
- 50%+ improvement in page load times
- Modern developer experience with React ecosystem
- Scalable architecture for community growth
- Preserved business logic and workflows
- Enhanced mobile and accessibility support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Decisions Made & Rationale

### Technology Stack Decisions

**React Framework**: Next.js
- **Why**: Server-side rendering for SEO, excellent developer experience, production-ready
- **Alternative**: Vite + React Router (considered but Next.js provides more out-of-the-box)

**State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query  
- **Why**: Simplicity over Redux complexity, excellent server state management
- **Alternative**: Redux Toolkit (considered but too complex for team size)

**UI Framework**: Chakra UI + Tailwind CSS
- **Why**: Component library speed + styling flexibility, excellent TypeScript support
- **Alternative**: Material-UI (considered but larger bundle size)

**Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod
- **Why**: Performance, TypeScript integration, validation consistency
- **Alternative**: Formik + Yup (considered but React Hook Form more performant)

### Strategic Decisions

**New Repository vs In-Place Migration**
- **Decision**: Create entirely new WitchCityRope-React repository
- **Why**: Clean architecture, no technical debt, parallel development capability
- **Risk Mitigated**: Avoids mixing Blazor/React patterns during transition

**API Approach**: Port vs Rebuild
- **Decision**: Port 95% of API layer directly to new repository
- **Why**: Minimal Blazor dependencies found, battle-tested business logic
- **Time Saved**: ~800-1000 hours of business logic recreation

**Documentation Strategy**: Complete System Migration
- **Decision**: Migrate entire documentation and AI workflow system day one
- **Why**: Preserves productivity, maintains quality standards, enables continued orchestration
- **Critical**: Without this, team productivity drops significantly
