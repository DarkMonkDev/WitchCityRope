# Questions and Decisions

## Open Questions

### Authentication
- [ ] Should we maintain JWT-based auth or explore other modern patterns?
- [ ] How to handle session management in React vs current server-side sessions?
- [ ] Multi-factor authentication implementation approach?

### Architecture
- [ ] Single Page Application (SPA) vs Server-Side Rendering (SSR)?
- [ ] State management complexity - do we need Redux or is Context sufficient?
- [ ] Build tool selection - prioritize simplicity or advanced features?

### UI/UX
- [ ] Should we replicate current Syncfusion-based UI exactly or modernize?
- [ ] Accessibility requirements and compliance levels?
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements during migration?

### Technical
- [ ] TypeScript adoption level (strict vs gradual)?
- [ ] Testing strategy changes from current E2E Playwright setup?
- [ ] Deployment and hosting considerations for React vs Blazor?

### Business
- [ ] Migration timeline and phased rollout strategy?
- [ ] Parallel development during migration period?
- [ ] User training and change management needs?

## Decisions Made

### Project Constraints
- ✅ Research-only phase - no code modifications
- ✅ Document everything in /docs/architecture/react-migration/
- ✅ Consider community-scale application (not enterprise)
- ✅ Maintain all current functionality

### Research Scope
- ✅ Focus on 2024-2025 current best practices
- ✅ Prioritize production-ready, maintained libraries
- ✅ Include multiple options with pros/cons

## Decision Points Needed

### High Priority
1. **Authentication Strategy** - Needs decision by end of research phase
2. **State Management Approach** - Critical for architecture planning
3. **Component Library Selection** - Impacts development timeline

### Medium Priority
1. **Build Tool Selection** - Affects developer experience
2. **TypeScript Adoption Level** - Impacts development standards
3. **Testing Strategy Evolution** - Quality assurance approach

### Low Priority
1. **Deployment Strategy** - Can be decided during implementation
2. **Performance Optimization** - Can be addressed post-migration
3. **Advanced Features** - Can be roadmap items

## Notes
- All decisions should consider the volunteer/community nature of the project
- Simplicity and maintainability should be prioritized over advanced features
- Migration should not disrupt current user experience
