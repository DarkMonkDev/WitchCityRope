## Research Summary

### Key Findings
- **Recommended Stack**: Vite + React + TypeScript + Chakra UI + Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand + TanStack Query hybrid approach
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with HTTP-only cookies
- **Forms**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **API Layer**: Axios with interceptors + TanStack Query

### Documentation Created
1. **Current Features Inventory** - Comprehensive analysis of existing Blazor implementation
2. **Authentication Research** - Modern React auth patterns and security best practices
3. **React Architecture** - State management, routing, and build tools comparison
4. **UI Components Research** - Component library analysis with Chakra UI recommendation
5. **Validation Research** - Form handling strategies with React Hook Form + Zod
6. **CMS Integration** - Content management options with hybrid file-based approach
7. **API Integration** - HTTP client and server state management recommendations
8. **Architectural Recommendations** - Complete technology stack with ADRs
9. **Migration Plan** - 16-week phased migration with detailed timeline

### Key Recommendations
- **Parallel Development**: Build React alongside Blazor to minimize risk
- **Feature Parity**: Maintain all current functionality during migration
- **Performance Focus**: Target 50% improvement in page load times
- **Security First**: Implement modern authentication patterns
- **Team Training**: Adequate preparation for React development
