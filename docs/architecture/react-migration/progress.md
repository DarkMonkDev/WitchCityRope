## Phase 3: Next - Vertical Slice Implementation

### Working Folder Prepared
`/docs/functional-areas/vertical-slice-home-page/`
- Requirements folder
- Design folder
- Implementation folder
- Testing folder
- Lessons-learned folder
- README with workflow phases
- WORKFLOW_QUALITY_GATES.md

### Sub-Agents Ready
- **ui-designer**: Mockups and wireframes
- **backend-developer**: API development
- **react-developer**: React components
- **test-developer**: Test writing
- **test-executor**: Test running
- **lint-validator**: Code quality
- **prettier-formatter**: Code formatting
- **librarian**: Documentation

### Vertical Slice Scope
**Goal**: Implement a minimal home page that displays events from the API
- Create Events API endpoint with mock data
- Create React home page component
- Setup API integration with Axios/TanStack Query
- Write E2E test with Playwright
- Document lessons learned

## How to Continue

### 1. Start Claude Code in Project Directory
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
claude-code .
```

### 2. Use the Orchestrate Command
The `/orchestrate` command is ready to coordinate the full workflow with all sub-agents.

### 3. Access Old Project When Needed
Reference the original Blazor project for API code to migrate:
```bash
# From witchcityrope-react directory:
../witchcityrope/src/WitchCityRope.Api/
../witchcityrope/src/WitchCityRope.Core/
```

## Important Notes

### Documentation Standards
- Every file operation MUST be logged in file registry
- Each agent has their own lessons-learned file
- Use LESSONS_LEARNED_SYSTEM.md for guidance

### Workflow Process
- Phase 1: Requirements (with human review)
- Phase 2: Design
- Phase 3: Implementation (with human review after first slice)
- Phase 4: Testing (with mandatory lint validation)
- Phase 5: Finalization (with mandatory formatting)

### Known Issues
- Docker ports may conflict with old project on 5433, 5653
- Either stop old project or use different ports

## Key Migration Recommendations
- **Parallel Development**: Build React alongside Blazor to minimize risk
- **Feature Parity**: Maintain all current functionality during migration
- **Performance Focus**: Target 50% improvement in page load times
- **Security First**: Implement modern authentication patterns
- **Team Training**: Adequate preparation for React development
