# API Cleanup and Feature Extraction Session Prompt

<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-13 -->
<!-- Version: 2.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Librarian Agent -->
<!-- Status: COMPLETE - Legacy API Archived -->

## SESSION OBJECTIVE: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

**MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**: The duplicate API projects crisis has been successfully resolved. Legacy API has been archived with all valuable features migrated to the modern API. This document is preserved for historical reference and future similar situations.

## MANDATORY PRE-WORK CHECKLIST

Before starting ANY work, you MUST:

1. **Read the Investigation Report**: `/docs/architecture/critical-issue-duplicate-apis-investigation.md` 
   - This contains the complete forensic analysis of the duplicate API situation
   - Understand the timeline, root cause, and technical differences
   - Review the recommended resolution plan

2. **Read Backend Lessons Learned**: `/docs/lessons-learned/backend-lessons-learned.md`
   - Contains critical lessons about which API is active and which is legacy
   - Section: "CRITICAL FIX: Duplicate API Projects Detection" (line 205)
   - Section: "Minimal API Event Update Implementation" shows modern API architecture

3. **Verify Current State**:
   ```bash
   # Verify which API is actually running
   curl -s http://localhost:5655/health || echo "Modern API not running"
   curl -s http://localhost:5653/health || echo "Legacy API not running"
   
   # Check React frontend configuration
   grep -r "5655\|5653" apps/web/src/config/
   ```

## THE DUPLICATE API SITUATION

### Primary Active API (KEEP THIS ONE)
- **Location**: `/apps/api/` 
- **Port**: 5655
- **Technology**: ASP.NET Core Minimal API (.NET 9)
- **Architecture**: Vertical Slice Architecture  
- **Status**: **CURRENTLY SERVING REACT FRONTEND**
- **Performance**: 49ms response times achieved
- **Features**: Health, Authentication, Events, Users
- **Creation**: August 15, 2025 for React migration

### Legacy API (‚úÖ ARCHIVED)
- **Location**: `/src/_archive/WitchCityRope.Api/`
- **Port**: Not currently running
- **Technology**: ASP.NET Core API (.NET)  
- **Architecture**: Full-featured API with Infrastructure patterns
- **Status**: **‚úÖ ARCHIVED 2025-09-13**
- **Features**: Auth, CheckIn, Dashboard, Events, Payments, Safety, Vetting
- **Creation**: June 28, 2025 for Blazor Server

### Root Cause
During React migration in August 2025, a NEW simplified API was created at `/apps/api/` instead of refactoring the existing API at `/src/WitchCityRope.Api/`. The legacy API was never cleaned up, creating architectural duplication.

## SESSION WORK PLAN - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### Phase 1: Feature Extraction Analysis - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### 1.1 Legacy API Feature Inventory - ‚úÖ COMPLETE
Complete inventory of ALL features successfully migrated from legacy API:

**Completed Migrations**:
- ‚úÖ **CheckIn System**: Migrated to `/apps/api/Features/CheckIn/`
- ‚úÖ **Safety Features**: Migrated to `/apps/api/Features/Safety/` 
- ‚úÖ **Vetting System**: Migrated to `/apps/api/Features/Vetting/`
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Payment Features**: Migrated to `/apps/api/Features/Payment/`
- ‚úÖ **Advanced Dashboard Features**: Migrated to `/apps/api/Features/Dashboard/`

**Deliverables Completed**: All feature analysis completed and features successfully migrated with:
- Complete feature inventory with descriptions
- Business criticality assessment (Critical/Important/Nice-to-Have)
- Implementation complexity estimates
- Dependencies between features

#### 1.2 Modern API Capability Assessment
Document exactly what the modern API CAN do:

**Investigation Tasks**:
- Review all endpoints in `/apps/api/Features/`
- Test all functionality via curl/API testing
- Document performance characteristics
- Identify any gaps compared to legacy API

**Deliverable**: Update feature analysis document with modern API capabilities comparison

#### 1.3 Feature Extraction Priority Matrix
**Decision Required**: For each legacy feature, determine:
- **EXTRACT**: Must be migrated to modern API (business critical)
- **ARCHIVE**: Document but don't migrate (historical value only)
- **DISCARD**: Obsolete or redundant functionality

### Phase 2: Critical Feature Migration (Days 2-4)

#### 2.1 Extract Critical Features (If Any Identified)
For features marked as EXTRACT in Phase 1:

**Migration Process**:
1. **Create Feature Branch**: `git checkout -b feature/extract-legacy-[feature-name]`
2. **Implement in Modern Architecture**: Follow vertical slice pattern in `/apps/api/Features/`
3. **Port Business Logic**: Extract domain logic from legacy API
4. **Create Tests**: Add comprehensive test coverage
5. **Test Integration**: Verify with React frontend
6. **Document**: Update API documentation

**Critical Requirements**:
- **NEVER modify legacy API** - only extract FROM it
- **Follow modern API patterns** - vertical slice architecture
- **Maintain performance** - 49ms response time targets
- **Test thoroughly** - comprehensive test coverage required

#### 2.2 Database Schema Verification
**CRITICAL**: Ensure both APIs use compatible database schemas:

**Verification Tasks**:
- Compare Entity Framework models between both APIs
- Identify schema conflicts or differences
- Test database operations from both APIs (if needed for extraction)
- Document any schema migrations required

**Safety Measures**:
- **NEVER run both APIs simultaneously against same database**
- Create database backup before any schema changes
- Test all migrations in development environment first

### Phase 3: Legacy API Archival - ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### 3.1 Comprehensive Documentation - ‚úÖ COMPLETE

## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS AND WARNINGS

### NEVER DO THESE THINGS
- ‚ùå **NEVER run both APIs simultaneously** - Database conflicts possible  
- ‚ùå **NEVER modify legacy API** - It's read-only for extraction
- ‚ùå **NEVER add new features to legacy API** - It's being archived
- ‚ùå **NEVER break the modern API** - It's serving production traffic
- ‚ùå **NEVER skip testing** - Frontend integration must work

### ALWAYS DO THESE THINGS
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS test after each change** - Verify nothing breaks
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS backup before major changes** - Database safety first
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS use git branches** - For any extraction work  
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS document decisions** - Why extracted vs archived
- ‚úÖ **ALWAYS update file registry** - Track all file operations

### ARCHITECTURE CONSTRAINTS
- **Modern API Architecture**: Vertical slice pattern ONLY
- **Performance Requirements**: Maintain <50ms response times
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer tokens with httpOnly cookies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests required

## GOTCHAS AND COMMON ISSUES

### Port Configuration Issues
- **Problem**: Multiple port references scattered throughout codebase
- **Solution**: Use centralized configuration in `/apps/web/src/config/api.ts`
- **Warning**: Some test files may have hard-coded legacy ports

### Test File Legacy References
- **Problem**: Test files reference legacy API port 5653 instead of modern API port 5655
- **Solution**: Update test configurations to use environment variables
- **Files**: Check `/tests/`, `/apps/web/src/test/`, Playwright configurations

### Docker Container Confusion
- **Problem**: Multiple API containers or configurations
- **Solution**: Clean up docker-compose files to reference only modern API
- **Warning**: API container may need rebuild after changes

### Entity Framework Differences
- **Problem**: Legacy and modern APIs may have different EF models
- **Solution**: Carefully compare entity definitions before extraction
- **Warning**: Database schema conflicts possible if both APIs run

### Authentication Method Differences
- **Problem**: Different authentication implementations between APIs
- **Solution**: Stick with modern API authentication patterns
- **Warning**: Don't try to merge authentication systems
