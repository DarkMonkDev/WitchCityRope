# UI Framework Decision: Syncfusion Blazor

## Decision Date
December 25, 2024

## Status
Decided - Will use Syncfusion Blazor components

## Context
We need a comprehensive UI component library for building the Witch City Rope platform with Blazor Server. Initially considered MudBlazor as a free, open-source option.

## Decision
Use **Syncfusion Blazor components** instead of MudBlazor because:
- Developer has an active Syncfusion subscription
- No additional licensing costs
- More comprehensive component set
- Professional support available

## Rationale

### Advantages of Syncfusion
1. **Comprehensive Components**
   - Advanced data grid with filtering, sorting, grouping
   - Full calendar/scheduler component for events
   - Rich text editor for event descriptions
   - PDF generation for reports
   - Charts for analytics

2. **Professional Features**
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.0)
   - Touch-optimized mobile components
   - Extensive theming options
   - Localization support
   - Performance optimized

3. **Development Speed**
   - Extensive documentation
   - Code examples for every component
   - Visual Studio integration
   - Professional support team
   - Regular updates

4. **Specific Components for Our Needs**
   - DateTimePicker for event scheduling
   - Multiselect dropdown for filtering
   - Accordion for mobile navigation
   - Dialog/Modal for check-in
   - Upload component for images
   - Form validation framework

### Components Mapping

|---------|---------------------|
| Event List | DataGrid with custom templates |
| Event Calendar | Schedule component |

| Check-in Interface | ListView with search |
| Reports | Charts and Grid export |

## Implementation Notes

1. **License Setup**
   - Add Syncfusion NuGet source
   - Install Syncfusion.Blazor package
   - Register license key in Program.cs

2. **Theme Selection**
   - Start with Material theme
   - Customize colors to match branding
   - Dark mode using built-in theme switching

3. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Use adaptive triggers
   - Touch-friendly components
   - Responsive grid layouts

## Alternatives Considered

- ❌ Much slower development
- ❌ Need to build everything custom
- ❌ Accessibility compliance harder
