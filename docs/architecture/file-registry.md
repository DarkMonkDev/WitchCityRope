## File Categories

### Active Project Files
Files that are part of the permanent project structure and should be maintained.

### Temporary Files
Files created for specific tasks or sessions that should be cleaned up after use.

### Archived Files
Files that have been moved to appropriate archive locations.

## Cleanup Guidelines

- **Temporary files** should be reviewed at the end of each session
- **Session work** files older than 30 days should be archived or deleted
- **Investigation reports** should be archived after resolution
- **Active files** should only be deleted if they become truly obsolete

## Notes

This registry helps track file proliferation and ensures proper project hygiene. When in doubt about file retention, preserve with a clear cleanup date rather than delete immediately.
