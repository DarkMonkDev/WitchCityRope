## Archived File Registry

This section contains files that have been moved to archive locations or deleted entirely.

### Archives
- All files in `/docs/_archive/` directories are considered archived and should not be directly referenced in active work
- Archive directories are maintained for historical reference only
- See individual archive README files for specific archival reasons and replacement guidance

## File Registry Usage Guidelines

1. **MANDATORY**: Every file create/modify/delete operation must be logged
2. **Required Fields**: Date, File Path, Action, Purpose, Session/Task, Status
3. **Cleanup Date**: Set for temporary files or when archival is expected
4. **Status Values**: ACTIVE, ARCHIVED, TEMPORARY, DEPRECATED
5. **Action Types**: CREATED, MODIFIED, DELETED, MOVED, RENAMED

## File Organization Enforcement

As of 2025-08-23, the following architecture standards are MANDATORY:

### Approved File Locations
- **Scripts (.sh files)**: `/scripts/` directory ONLY
- **Test Files**: `/tests/` directory or appropriate subdirectories
- **HTML Design Files**: `/docs/design/wireframes/` directory
- **Utility Scripts**: `/scripts/` directory

### Architecture Violations - RESOLVED 2025-08-23
- ✅ CLEAN: All unauthorized files removed from project root
- ✅ CLEAN: Scripts properly organized in `/scripts/` directory with subdirectories
- ✅ CLEAN: Test files in proper locations
- ✅ CLEAN: Session work archived to proper location

### Enforcement Process - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY 2025-08-23
1. ✅ **Detection**: All violations identified through validation suite
2. ✅ **Violation Response**: All violations resolved systematically
3. ✅ **Organization**: Files moved to proper locations with complete registry logging
4. ✅ **Validation**: Structure confirmed clean via validation suite
5. ✅ **Archive Management**: Session work properly archived with documentation
6. ✅ **Final Cleanup**: API Architecture Modernization scope complete

This registry ensures complete traceability and prevents orphaned files that cause project maintenance issues.
