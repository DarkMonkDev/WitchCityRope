## Archive Registry

| Date | File Path | Action | Purpose | Archive Status | Final Disposition |
|------|-----------|--------|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| 2025-08-22 | /docs/00-START-HERE.md | ARCHIVED | Legacy navigation document - superseded by functional-area-master-index.md system | ARCHIVED | Permanently moved to /docs/_archive/00-start-here-legacy-2025-08-22/ |

## File Organization Standards

### Mandatory Rules
1. **ALL file operations MUST be logged immediately**
2. **NO files in /docs/ root directory**
3. **Archive folders: One unified /docs/_archive/ only**
4. **Session work: Use /session-work/YYYY-MM-DD/ pattern**
5. **NO duplicates: Check existing files before creating**

### Actions Required Before File Creation
- [ ] Check file registry for duplicates  
- [ ] Verify target directory follows standards
- [ ] Confirm purpose aligns with directory structure
- [ ] Log entry prepared for immediate addition

### Cleanup Protocol
- Monthly review of TEMPORARY status files
- Archive inactive files older than 6 months
- Remove duplicate or obsolete entries
- Update status based on project evolution
