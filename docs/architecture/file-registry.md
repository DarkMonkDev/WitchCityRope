# File Registry - WitchCityRope Project

> **CRITICAL**: Every file created, modified, or deleted by Claude or any AI agent MUST be logged here.
> 
> **Purpose**: Track all files to prevent orphaned documents and maintain project cleanliness.

## Archived File Registry

This section contains files that have been moved to archive locations or deleted entirely.

### Archives
- All files in `/docs/_archive/` directories are considered archived and should not be directly referenced in active work
- Archive directories are maintained for historical reference only
- See individual archive README files for specific archival reasons and replacement guidance

## File Registry Usage Guidelines

1. **MANDATORY**: Every file create/modify/delete operation must be logged
2. **Required Fields**: Date, File Path, Action, Purpose, Session/Task, Status
3. **Cleanup Date**: Set for temporary files or when archival is expected
4. **Status Values**: ACTIVE, ARCHIVED, TEMPORARY, DEPRECATED
5. **Action Types**: CREATED, MODIFIED, DELETED, MOVED, RENAMED

## File Organization Enforcement

As of 2025-08-23, the following architecture standards are MANDATORY:

### Approved File Locations
- **Scripts (.sh files)**: `/scripts/` directory ONLY
- **Test Files**: `/tests/` directory or appropriate subdirectories
- **HTML Design Files**: `/docs/design/wireframes/` directory
- **Utility Scripts**: `/scripts/` directory

### Architecture Violations
- Any files in project root (except `dev.sh` and standard project files)
- Scripts mixed with source code
- Test files in random locations

### Enforcement Process
1. **Detection**: Automated file organization check during test-executor startup
2. **Violation Response**: Immediate halt of work until files organized
3. **Organization**: Files moved to proper locations with registry logging
4. **Validation**: Confirmation all references updated and functional

This registry ensures complete traceability and prevents orphaned files that cause project maintenance issues.
