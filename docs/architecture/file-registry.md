## Cleanup Guidelines

- **TEMPORARY** files should be in `/session-work/[date]/`
- **ACTIVE** files are permanent project documentation
- **ARCHIVED** files moved to `/docs/_archive/` with context
- **Review monthly** for outdated TEMPORARY files
- **Never delete** without logging the deletion here
