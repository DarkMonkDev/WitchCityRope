# File Registry - WitchCityRope Project

> **CRITICAL**: Every file created, modified, or deleted by Claude or any AI agent MUST be logged here.
>
> **Purpose**: Track all files to prevent orphaned documents and maintain project cleanliness.

## File Categories

### ACTIVE
Files currently in use and relevant to ongoing development.

### EVIDENCE
Test files and artifacts that serve as evidence but can be cleaned up after verification period.

### ARCHIVED
Historical files moved to archive but kept for reference.

### TEMPORARY
Files created for immediate use that should be cleaned up quickly.

## Cleanup Schedule

### Evidence Files (6 months retention)
- Test specification files: Review and clean up after 6 months
- Test result artifacts: Clean up after 3 months
- Debug screenshots and videos: Clean up after 1 month

### Archive Files (2 years retention)
- Historical documentation: Review annually
- Deprecated standards: Keep for reference but mark clearly

### Temporary Files (1 week retention)
- Debug files: Clean up weekly
- Scratch documents: Clean up at session end
- Draft documents: Convert to active or delete

## Usage Guidelines

### When Creating Files
1. **Always log in this registry** - No exceptions
2. **Use descriptive purposes** - Future developers need context
3. **Choose appropriate status** - Helps with cleanup automation
4. **Set cleanup dates** - Prevents accumulation of stale files

### When Modifying Files
1. **Log modifications** - Track significant changes
2. **Update status if needed** - Files may change category
3. **Adjust cleanup dates** - Modified files may need longer retention

### When Deleting Files
1. **Log deletions** - Track what was removed and why
2. **Archive important content** - Don't lose valuable information
3. **Update references** - Fix broken links in other documents

## File Organization Standards

### Documentation Structure
- `/docs/functional-areas/[area]/` - Feature-specific docs
- `/docs/standards-processes/` - Project standards
- `/docs/architecture/` - Architectural decisions
- `/docs/lessons-learned/` - Knowledge from experience

### Test Structure
- `/tests/unit/` - Unit test files
- `/tests/integration/` - Integration test files
- `/tests/playwright/` - E2E test files
- `/test-results/` - Test execution artifacts

### Development Artifacts
- `/session-work/YYYY-MM-DD/` - Daily work files
- `/scripts/` - Utility scripts
- `/tools/` - Development tools
