## Cleanup Schedule

### Weekly Cleanup (Every Monday)
- Review TEMPORARY files approaching cleanup date
- Move completed session work to archive
- Update file statuses based on current usage

### Monthly Review (First Monday of month)
- Archive old session work folders
- Review ACTIVE files for continued relevance  
- Update cleanup dates for ongoing work

### Cleanup Targets for Week of 2025-09-16
- Delete screenshot files from 2025-09-10 testing

- Archive completed testing artifacts

## File Categories

### ACTIVE
Files currently in use or reference documents needed for ongoing development.

### TEMPORARY  
Files with specific cleanup dates, usually test artifacts, screenshots, or session notes.

### INVESTIGATION
Read-only analysis work that provides context but doesn't create permanent artifacts.

### ARCHIVED
Files moved to `/docs/_archive/` with historical value but no longer needed for active development.
