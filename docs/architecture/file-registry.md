## Notes
- All files in `/docs/functional-areas/` are considered permanent documentation
- Session work files in `/session-work/` should be moved to appropriate permanent locations before session end
- Temporary analysis files should be cleaned up after 30 days unless moved to permanent storage
- Always document file purpose clearly to help future developers understand context
