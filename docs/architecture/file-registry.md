## File Registry Guidelines

### When to Add Entries
- **ALWAYS** add an entry for every file you create, modify, or delete
- **IMMEDIATELY** after the file operation is complete
- **INCLUDE** both temporary session files and permanent project files

### Required Information
- **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD format (use actual date)
- **File Path**: Full absolute path from project root
- **Action**: CREATED, MODIFIED, DELETED
- **Purpose**: Clear description of why the file exists/was changed
- **Session/Task**: Brief description of the work being done
- **Status**: ACTIVE, ARCHIVED, TEMPORARY
- **Cleanup Date**: When to review/clean up (use "Keep permanent" for core files)

### File Status Guidelines
- **ACTIVE**: Core project files that should remain
- **ARCHIVED**: Completed work that has ongoing reference value
- **TEMPORARY**: Session work or files with planned deletion dates

### Cleanup Guidelines
- Review files on their cleanup dates
- Move session work to `/session-work/` if not already there
- Archive completed documentation with historical value
- Delete truly temporary files
- Update file registry when files are moved or deleted
