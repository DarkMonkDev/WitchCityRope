## Registry Rules

1. **ALL file operations must be logged** (create, modify, delete)
2. **Use absolute paths** starting from project root
3. **Describe purpose clearly** - What does this file do? Why was it created?
4. **Link to task/session** - Which task or session created this?
5. **Set cleanup date** - When should this be reviewed? Use "Never" for permanent files.
6. **Update status** - ACTIVE, DEPRECATED, ARCHIVED, TEMPORARY, DELETED

## Cleanup Schedule

- Review TEMPORARY files monthly
- Archive session-work files after 30 days
- Delete obsolete test results after cleanup date
- Keep all production code files (ACTIVE status)

## File Categories

### PERMANENT (Never clean up)
- Production code files (`/apps/`, `/packages/`)
- Core documentation (`/docs/`)
- Configuration files (`.config`, `.json`)

### TEMPORARY (Clean up after date)
- Session work files (`/session-work/`)
- Test results (`/test-results/`)
- Investigation reports

### DEPRECATED (Remove when safe)
- Replaced components
- Obsolete documentation
- Old configuration files
