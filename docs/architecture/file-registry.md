## Cleanup Schedule

### 2025-09-26 (Week from 2025-09-19)
- Review and clean up temporary test files created for persistence validation
- Migrate valuable test patterns to permanent test suite
- Delete temporary E2E test files if no longer needed

### 2025-08-24 (Week from 2025-08-17)
- Review Docker helper scripts for production readiness
- Clean up any temporary Docker configurations
- Evaluate container optimization opportunities

### Monthly Reviews
- Review all TEMPORARY files for relevance
- Update STATUS as needed (ACTIVE, ARCHIVED, DEPRECATED)
- Clean up orphaned documentation
- Validate all ACTIVE files are still in use

## Status Definitions

- **ACTIVE**: File is currently in use and should be maintained
- **TEMPORARY**: File created for specific task, scheduled for cleanup
- **ARCHIVED**: File moved to archive, kept for historical reference
- **DEPRECATED**: File no longer used but kept for transition period
