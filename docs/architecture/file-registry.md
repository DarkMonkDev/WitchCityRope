5. Include **session context** for future reference
6. Update **status** as work progresses
7. Set **cleanup date** for temporary files

### Status Definitions:
- **ACTIVE**: File is currently being worked on or recently completed
- **COMPLETED**: File serves its purpose and should be retained
- **TEMPORARY**: File will be cleaned up on specified date
- **ARCHIVED**: Moved to archive location, no longer active

### Cleanup Guidelines:
- Session work files: Archive after 30 days
- Temporary analysis files: Delete after 7 days
- Research documents: Keep permanently if decision-critical
- Implementation files: Keep permanently
- Test files: Keep permanently
