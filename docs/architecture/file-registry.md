## Cleanup Guidelines

- **TEMPORARY** files should be in `/session-work/[date]/`
- **TEST RESULTS** should be cleaned up after issues are resolved
- **SOURCE CODE** tracking should be removed (git handles this)
- **PURPOSE** field should be 100-150 characters maximum
- **DETAILED INFO** belongs in the file itself, not the registry
