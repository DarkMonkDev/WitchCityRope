# File Registry - WitchCityRope Project

> **CRITICAL**: Every file created, modified, or deleted by Claude or any AI agent MUST be logged here.
> 
> **Purpose**: Track all files to prevent orphaned documents and maintain project cleanliness.

## End of Session Checklist

When ending a session, complete this checklist:

- [ ] All files created/modified during session are logged above
- [ ] Session-specific temporary files moved to `/session-work/YYYY-MM-DD/` 
- [ ] Final status updated for all files (PERMANENT/ARCHIVED/TEMPORARY)
- [ ] Any files marked as TEMPORARY have cleanup dates set
- [ ] Files that should be permanent are committed to git

## Guidelines

### File Status Types
- **PERMANENT**: Core project files that should remain indefinitely
- **ARCHIVED**: Old files moved to `_archive` for reference
- **TEMPORARY**: Session-specific files with planned cleanup dates

### Naming Standards
- Use descriptive names that include context
- Include date in temporary file names: `analysis-2025-01-20.md`
- Avoid generic names like `status.md`, `temp.md`, `notes.md`

### Location Standards
- **Documentation**: `/docs/` with appropriate subdirectory
