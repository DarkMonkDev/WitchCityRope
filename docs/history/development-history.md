- `/.env` - Created with development configuration
- `/docker-compose.yml` - Configured for development with hot reload

**Docker Configuration:**
- Web container: `http://localhost:5651`
- API container: `http://localhost:5653`
- PostgreSQL: `localhost:5433`
- Shared keys volume for cookie authentication

#### Current Status

✅ **Working:**
- Admin dashboard loads and displays events from API
- Authentication properly forwarded between Web and API services
- Event management page shows all events with action buttons
- Docker development environment with hot reload capability

⚠️ **In Progress:**
- Event edit functionality (route works, but build errors prevent form loading)
- Multiple compilation errors in Infrastructure project need resolution

❌ **Blocked:**
- Application build failing due to missing interface references
- EventEdit form cannot be tested until build succeeds

#### Summary

Today's session successfully resolved the admin dashboard event display issue by fixing the authentication flow between the Web and API services. The root cause was the ApiClient not using the properly configured HttpClient with authentication handlers. While the event edit page route configuration has been fixed, build errors are currently preventing the full edit functionality from being tested. Once these compilation issues are resolved, the event edit flow should work as designed with the comprehensive form interface already implemented.

### January 10, 2025 (Session 3) - Critical EF Core Migration Fix & Event Configuration Testing ✅ COMPLETED

#### Overview
Fixed a critical EF Core migration blocker that was preventing database updates. The issue involved entity discovery through navigation properties, leading to the infamous "EmailAddress requires a primary key" error. Successfully implemented volunteer and email template features with comprehensive testing.

#### Critical Issue Fixed: EF Core Entity Discovery
1. **Root Cause Identified**
   - Even though Core.User was explicitly ignored in DbContext, EF Core discovered it through VolunteerAssignment's User navigation property
   - This caused EF Core to discover the EmailAddress value object and attempt to create it as an entity
   - Error: "The entity type 'EmailAddress' requires a primary key to be defined"

2. **Solution Implemented**
   - Removed User navigation property from VolunteerAssignment entity
   - Updated VolunteerAssignmentConfiguration to remove User relationship
   - Fixed VolunteerService to remove all .Include(a => a.User) statements
   - Added explicit Core.User exclusion in WitchCityRopeIdentityDbContext

3. **Migration Scripts Created**
   - Created generate-migration.sh for consistent migration generation
   - Created apply-migrations.sh for applying migrations to database
   - Successfully generated and applied "AddVolunteerAndEmailEntities" migration

#### Key Learnings Documented
1. **Navigation Properties Can Break Migrations**
   - Even explicitly ignored entities can be discovered through navigation properties
   - Always remove ALL navigation properties to replaced/ignored entities
   - Use only foreign key IDs for relationships to ignored entities

2. **Value Objects vs Entities**
   - EF Core doesn't automatically distinguish between value objects and entities
   - Must configure value objects as owned types or store as primitives
   - EmailAddress is now stored as string in database, used as value object in domain

3. **Include() Statements After Architecture Changes**
   - Services must be updated when navigation properties are removed
   - Fetch related data separately using foreign keys
   - Example: Use UserManager.FindByIdAsync() instead of Include()

4. **Constructor Parameters Must Match**
   - EF Core constructor binding is case-sensitive
   - Seed data parameter names must exactly match entity constructor parameters
   - TimeOnly vs DateTime conversions must be handled properly

#### Implementation Completed
1. **DbInitializer Enhanced**
   - Added SeedVolunteerTasksAsync() - Creates 5 task types per event
   - Added SeedVolunteerAssignmentsAsync() - Creates sample assignments
   - Added SeedEventEmailTemplatesAsync() - Creates 4 template types per event
   - Fixed all compilation errors (DateTime→TimeOnly, UserRole properties)

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created comprehensive Puppeteer test suite:
     - test-event-configuration.js - Full event creation workflow
     - test-email-templates.js - Email template management
     - test-volunteer-management.js - Volunteer task/assignment testing
     - test-event-simple-check.js - Basic functionality verification
   - All tests include screenshots for visual verification

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with "Critical EF Core Entity Discovery Learnings" section
   - Enhanced migration best practices with specific examples
   - Added warnings about common pitfalls to prevent future issues

#### Technical Impact
- Database now properly supports volunteer management and email templates
- Migration process is standardized and documented
- Future developers have clear guidance on avoiding entity discovery issues
- Event configuration features are fully integrated and testable

Fixed all compilation errors in Core and Infrastructure projects after the major refactoring from Registration model to Ticket + RSVP model. Created comprehensive E2E Puppeteer tests for the new functionality.

#### Key Accomplishments

1. **Core Project Compilation Fixes**
   - Fixed duplicate DTO definitions (EventTicketRequest, RsvpDto) already in CommonDtos.cs
   - Created missing RsvpStatus enum with proper values (Confirmed, Waitlisted, CheckedIn, Cancelled)
   - Updated all RegistrationStatus references to TicketStatus
   - Fixed property name changes (RegisteredAt → PurchasedAt)

2. **Infrastructure Project Compilation Fixes**
   - Updated all DbContext references from Registrations to Tickets
   - Fixed Event entity method calls (GetConfirmedRegistrationCount → GetConfirmedTicketCount)
   - Updated Payment entity references (RegistrationId → TicketId)
   - Fixed AutoMapper profiles to use Ticket instead of Registration
   - Removed duplicate TicketDto definition in TicketProfile.cs
   - Updated seed data in DbInitializer to use Ticket and Rsvp entities

3. **Navigation Property Issues Resolved**
   - WitchCityRopeUser doesn't have Tickets navigation property
   - Updated MemberRepository to query Tickets directly from DbContext
   - Fixed all LINQ queries to avoid navigation properties that don't exist

4. **E2E Test Suite Created**
   - `test-rsvp-functionality.js`: Comprehensive tests for RSVP functionality on social events
   - `test-ticket-functionality.js`: Tests for ticket functionality after Registration refactoring
   - Tests cover event creation, RSVP/ticket flows, admin management, and check-in

#### Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `/src/WitchCityRope.Core/Enums/RsvpStatus.cs` - Created new enum
- `/src/WitchCityRope.Core/DTOs/EventTicketRequest.cs` - Deleted (duplicate)

- Keyboard commands: `keyboard.press('Control+A')` → proper key sequences
- Route corrections: `/events` → `/member/events`, `/dashboard` → `/member/dashboard`
- Button selection: Look for "Create Event" not "Save as Draft"

#### Next Steps
- Debug SaveEvent method in EventEdit.razor
- Add proper error display to event creation form
- Fix JavaScript errors preventing form submission
- Ensure events are created as "Published" not "Draft"
- Implement proper validation feedback

#### Root Cause Fixes Applied

- **Warnings**: ~100 (mostly nullable reference warnings)
- Web application is ready to run and test!

### January 11, 2025 (Session 6) - Fixed Events Display Regression ✅ COMPLETED

#### Overview
Fixed a critical regression where no events were showing on the public /events page due to missing database tables from the Registration → Ticket + RSVP refactoring.

#### Issue Identified
- **Problem**: Events page showed "No events found" even though events existed in the database
- **Root Cause**: The GetUpcomingEventsAsync method was trying to include Tickets and Rsvps navigation properties, but these tables didn't exist in the database yet
- **Error**: "42P01: relation 'Tickets' does not exist"

#### Fix Applied
1. **Temporary Database Query Fix**:
   - Removed `.Include(e => e.Tickets)` and `.Include(e => e.Rsvps)` from the query
   - Changed `e.GetAvailableSpots()` to use `e.Capacity` directly
   - This allows events to display while the database migration is pending

2. **Migration Generated**:
   - Created migration "TicketRsvpRefactoring" to update database schema
   - Migration will drop Registrations table and create Tickets and Rsvps tables
   - Migration is ready to apply when appropriate

#### Verification
- ✅ Events now display correctly on /events page
- ✅ Found 11 events displaying properly
- ✅ Event filters work correctly
- ✅ All event cards show with proper formatting

#### Next Steps
- Apply the database migration when ready to fully implement Ticket/RSVP functionality
- Update seed data to create Tickets/RSVPs instead of Registrations
- Re-enable the Include statements once tables exist

### January 11, 2025 (Session 7) - Fixed All API Compilation Errors ✅ COMPLETED

#### Overview
Fixed all compilation errors in the API project after the Registration → Ticket + RSVP refactoring. The API now builds successfully and events display correctly with proper database support.

#### Major Fixes Applied

1. **Database Migration Applied**:
   - Applied the "TicketRsvpRefactoring" migration to create Tickets and Rsvps tables
   - Re-enabled Include statements for proper navigation property loading
   - Events now display with correct attendee counts using GetAvailableSpots()

2. **API Compilation Errors Fixed**:
   - Fixed 30+ compilation errors related to Registration → Ticket refactoring
   - Updated all DTOs to use correct property names (TicketId instead of RegistrationId)
   - Fixed EventTicketResponse ambiguity by using fully qualified names
   - Updated all service methods to use Ticket/RSVP entities instead of Registration
   - Fixed enum conversions between TicketStatus and RegistrationStatus

3. **Key Files Modified**:
   - **EventService.cs**: Complete refactoring to use Ticket entities
   - **DashboardController.cs**: Updated to query Tickets instead of Registrations
   - **NotificationService.cs**: Fixed to use Tickets for event notifications
   - **PaymentStubService.cs**: Updated to accept Ticket parameter
   - **TicketService.cs**: Added missing GetUserTicketsAsync method
   - **CheckInService.cs**: Updated to use TicketId in response

#### Technical Details

- **Removed References**: All Registration entity references replaced with Ticket

### January 11, 2025 (Session 8) - Fixed Remaining Test Compilation Errors ✅ COMPLETED

#### Overview
Completed fixing all remaining compilation errors after the Registration → Ticket + RSVP refactoring. Fixed Infrastructure tests, Integration tests, and identified that API/Web tests need complete rewrite due to architectural changes to ASP.NET Core Identity.

#### Major Fixes Applied

1. **DTO Property Updates**:
   - Added missing properties to RsvpDto: UserSceneName, UserEmail, ConfirmationCode, CheckedInAt, Comments
   - Added missing properties to TicketDto: AttendeeSceneName, AttendeeEmail
   - Changed Status properties from string to proper enum types (RsvpStatus, TicketStatus)

2. **Entity Reference Updates**:
   - Fixed all Event.Registrations references to use event.Tickets and event.Rsvps
   - Updated VettingStatus enum values: InReview → UnderReview, removed OnHold
   - Added missing CheckInAttendeeAsync method to ApiClient

3. **Test Infrastructure Fixes**:
   - Infrastructure Tests: Fixed IncidentReport constructor (reporter → reporterId)
   - Infrastructure Tests: Updated Payment.RegistrationId to Payment.TicketId
   - Infrastructure Tests: Removed unused User entity references
   - Integration Tests: Updated TestPaymentService to use Ticket instead of Registration

4. **Test Results**:
   - **Core Tests**: ✅ 202 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed
   - **Infrastructure Tests**: ✅ Builds successfully (tests may fail at runtime due to migration issues)
   - **Integration Tests**: ✅ Builds successfully with warnings only
   - **API Tests**: ❌ Need complete rewrite (old auth system, IJwtService, AuthService no longer exist)
   - **Web Tests**: ❌ Need complete rewrite (references to removed Auth components)

#### Key Learnings

1. **Architecture Migration Impact**: Moving from custom auth to ASP.NET Core Identity requires complete test rewrite
2. **Entity Refactoring**: Registration → Ticket refactoring touched every layer of the application
3. **DTO Consistency**: UI expectations must match DTO properties exactly
4. **Test Strategy**: Domain tests (Core) remain stable, infrastructure tests need updates for new architecture

#### Build Status
- ✅ Main application (Core, Infrastructure, Api, Web) builds successfully
- ✅ Core.Tests, Infrastructure.Tests, Integration.Tests build successfully
- ❌ Api.Tests, Web.Tests need complete rewrite for new architecture

#### Next Steps
- Address JavaScript console errors in the running application
- Consider rewriting API/Web tests to align with ASP.NET Core Identity
- Run integration tests against running application

### January 11, 2025 (Session 9) - Test Project Migration to ASP.NET Core Identity

#### Overview
Began comprehensive migration of API and Web test projects to work with ASP.NET Core Identity. Created test infrastructure, fixed many compilation errors, and established patterns for Identity-based testing.

#### Major Accomplishments

   - Updated TestDataBuilder to create Identity users
   - Resolved ambiguous type references with aliases
   - Updated PaymentService tests for new DTO structure
   - Fixed EventService method signatures
   - Updated Event entity usage to follow DDD patterns
   - Reduced compilation errors from 22+ to 26 remaining

3. **Web Test Migration Progress**:
   - Removed obsolete Blazor auth component tests (replaced by Identity pages)
   - Updated AuthServiceTests for SimplifiedIdentityAuthService
   - Fixed RegistrationDto references
   - Created documentation explaining test removal rationale
   - 70+ compilation errors remain to be fixed

4. **Documentation Created**:
   - Implementation plan with 9-day timeline
   - Technical design with code patterns and examples
   - Migration guide with step-by-step instructions
   - Completion summary documenting work done and remaining

#### Key Learnings

1. **Identity Migration Complexity**: Moving from custom auth to ASP.NET Core Identity requires extensive test rewrites, not just updates
2. **Component vs Page Testing**: Blazor component tests become integration tests when using Identity Razor Pages
3. **Service Evolution**: Many service interfaces changed significantly with Identity integration
4. **Test Strategy Shift**: From unit testing auth components to integration testing Identity flows

#### Current Status

- **API Tests**: ✅ Fixed in Session 10
- **Web Tests**: 70+ compilation errors remaining  
- **Test Infrastructure**: ✅ Complete and ready to use
- **Coverage**: Cannot measure until tests compile

#### Remaining Work (3-5 days estimated after Session 10)

1. Fix remaining compilation errors (1-2 days)
2. Write new Identity-specific tests (2-3 days)
3. Achieve 80% coverage target (1-2 days)

#### Files Created/Modified
- `/docs/enhancements/TestProjectMigration/` - All planning documents
- `/tests/WitchCityRope.Tests.Common/Identity/` - Test infrastructure
- Multiple test files in API and Web test projects

### January 11, 2025 (Session 10) - API Test Compilation Fixed ✅ COMPLETED

#### Major Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Constructor Issues**:
   - Converted all RegisterForEventRequest from object initializers to positional parameters
   - Fixed ListEventsRequest and CreateEventRequest constructor calls
   - Resolved parameter type mismatches

2. **Resolved Type Ambiguities**:
   - Added namespace aliases (ApiEventModels and CoreEnums) to resolve conflicts
   - Fixed all UserRole references (qualified with CoreEnums.UserRole)
   - Resolved EventType and PaymentMethod ambiguities
   - Fixed RegistrationStatus enum value issues (Cancelled → PaymentPending)

3. **Updated Service Interfaces**:
   - Fixed IEmailService mock to match current interface

   - Fixed CreateEventAsync missing organizerId parameter

4. **Fixed Type Conversions**:
   - Changed User to WitchCityRopeUser references
   - Updated CreateEventRequest from Api to Core.DTOs version
   - Fixed FluentAssertions API changes (BeLessOrEqualTo → BeLessThanOrEqualTo)

#### Technical Details

- **Namespace Conflicts**: Discovered duplicate enums in Api and Core namespaces with different values
- **Record vs Class**: Api models use records with positional parameters, Core DTOs use classes
- **Identity Integration**: Tests now properly use IdentityUserBuilder instead of UserBuilder
- **Mock Updates**: All service mocks updated to match current interface signatures

#### Results

- **Before**: 26 compilation errors
- **After**: 0 compilation errors ✅
- **Build Status**: SUCCESS
- **Warnings**: 6 (non-critical xUnit and async method warnings)

#### Next Steps

1. Fix Web test compilation errors (70+ remaining)
2. Run all tests to identify runtime issues
3. Write new Identity-specific tests
4. Achieve 80% code coverage target
