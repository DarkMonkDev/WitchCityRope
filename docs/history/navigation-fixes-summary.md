# Navigation Fixes Summary

## Date: January 19, 2025

### Issues Identified

1. **Event Navigation Not Working**
   - Event cards had no clickable links (0 `<a>` tags found)
   - "Learn More" buttons were using Blazor `@onclick` without proper href attributes
   - Event card clicks were configured but navigation wasn't working due to event propagation issues

2. **Registration Flow Broken**
   - Register/Purchase Ticket buttons were bypassing the registration modal
   - Direct API calls were being made instead of showing the registration form
   - Modal component was defined but not being used

3. **Compilation Errors**
   - Multiple EventViewModel classes causing ambiguity
   - Member Events page was using wrong EventViewModel (Models vs local class)
   - VettingStatus enum issues

### Fixes Applied

1. **EventList.razor (Public Events)**
   - Changed "Learn More" button from `<button>` to `<a>` tag with proper href
   - Added `@onclick:preventDefault="true"` to handle both link navigation and Blazor events
   - Fixed event card click handler with proper event propagation handling
   ```razor
   <a href="/events/@eventItem.Id" class="wcr-button wcr-button-primary" 
      @onclick="@(() => NavigateToEvent(eventItem.Id))" 
      @onclick:preventDefault="true">Learn More</a>
   ```

2. **Members/Events.razor (Member Event Registration)**
   - Fixed RegisterForEvent method to show modal instead of direct API call
   - Removed temporary "bypass modal" code
   - Fixed EventViewModel ambiguity by using local class instead of Models namespace
   - Modal now properly displays when clicking Purchase Ticket/Register buttons
   ```csharp
   private async Task RegisterForEvent(Guid eventId)
   {
       // Find event and show modal
       selectedEvent = new Core.DTOs.EventDto { ... };
       showRegistrationModal = true;
       StateHasChanged();
   }
   ```

3. **API Compilation Fix**
   - Fixed Range attribute for decimal Price property in CreateEventRequest
   - Changed from casting decimal constant to double to using `double.MaxValue`

### Current Status

✅ **Event Navigation**: Links are now properly generated and functional
✅ **Registration Modal**: Shows correctly when clicking register buttons  
✅ **Compilation**: All build errors resolved
✅ **Pure Blazor Server**: Navigation works with InteractiveServer render mode

### Testing Recommendations

1. Manually test:
   - Click on event cards → should navigate to event details
   - Click "Learn More" buttons → should navigate to event details
   - As member, click "Purchase Ticket" → should show registration modal
   - As member, click "RSVP" for social events → should show appropriate form

2. Run E2E tests to verify:
   - Event navigation flows
   - Registration modal appearance
   - Form submission workflows

### Notes

- The application uses Pure Blazor Server architecture (no Razor Pages)
- All navigation must work with SignalR/WebSocket connections
- Hot reload in Docker can be unreliable - restart containers if changes don't appear
