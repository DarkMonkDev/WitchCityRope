# PostgreSQL Integration Tests Migration - January 15, 2025

## Executive Summary

Successfully migrated all integration tests from in-memory database to real PostgreSQL using Testcontainers. This migration exposed and fixed 4 critical bugs that were hidden by the in-memory provider. Integration test success rate improved from 0% (unable to run) to 86% (115/133 passing).

## Background

The project was experiencing database provider conflicts preventing integration tests from running:
```
Services for database providers 'Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL', 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory' have been registered
```

User feedback correctly suggested using real PostgreSQL containers would provide better test fidelity than in-memory database.

## Implementation

### 1. Infrastructure Changes

#### TestWebApplicationFactory Rewrite
- Integrated Testcontainers.PostgreSql NuGet package
- Factory now spins up PostgreSQL 16-alpine container for each test run
- Runs real migrations and seed data against PostgreSQL
- Implements IAsyncLifetime for proper container lifecycle management

#### Test Collection Pattern
- Created PostgreSqlTestCollection with ICollectionFixture<TestWebApplicationFactory>
- All integration tests now share a single PostgreSQL container
- Improves performance while maintaining test isolation

### 2. Critical Bugs Discovered and Fixed

#### Bug 1: RefundAmount Nullable Owned Entity Configuration
**Issue**: EF Core cannot configure nullable owned entities with required properties
```
The property 'Payment.RefundAmount#Money.Amount' cannot be marked as nullable/optional because the type of the property is 'decimal'
```

**Fix**: Restructured Payment entity to use separate nullable properties:
```csharp
// New approach
public decimal? RefundAmountValue { get; private set; }
public string? RefundCurrency { get; private set; }

public Money? RefundAmount => RefundAmountValue.HasValue && !string.IsNullOrEmpty(RefundCurrency)
    ? Money.Create(RefundAmountValue.Value, RefundCurrency)
    : null;
```

#### Bug 2: RSVP Missing Id Initialization
**Issue**: RSVP entities created without Id caused duplicate key tracking errors
```
The instance of entity type 'Rsvp' cannot be tracked because another instance with the key value '{Id: 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}' is already being tracked
```

**Fix**: Added Id initialization in RSVP constructor:
```csharp
public Rsvp(WitchCityRopeUser user, Event @event)
{
    Id = Guid.NewGuid(); // Was missing!
    // ... rest of initialization
}
```

#### Bug 3: DateTime UTC Requirements
**Issue**: PostgreSQL timestamp with time zone only accepts UTC
```
Cannot write DateTime with Kind=Unspecified to PostgreSQL type 'timestamp with time zone', only UTC is supported
```

**Fix**: Added automatic UTC conversion in DbContext:
```csharp
foreach (var property in entry.Properties)
{
    if (property.CurrentValue is DateTime dateTime)
    {
        if (dateTime.Kind == DateTimeKind.Unspecified)
            property.CurrentValue = DateTime.SpecifyKind(dateTime, DateTimeKind.Utc);
        else if (dateTime.Kind == DateTimeKind.Local)
            property.CurrentValue = dateTime.ToUniversalTime();
    }
}
```

#### Bug 4: Duplicate Test Data
**Issue**: Tests failed with unique constraint violations on emails and scene names

**Fix**: All test data now uses GUIDs for uniqueness:
```csharp
var sceneName = SceneName.Create($"TestUser_{Guid.NewGuid():N}");
var email = $"test_{Guid.NewGuid():N}@example.com";
```

## Results

### Test Execution Metrics
- **Before**: 93 tests couldn't run (0% success)
- **After Migration**: 37 failures exposed (database issues)
- **After Fixes**: 115 passing, 18 failing (86% success)
- **Remaining Failures**: UI/navigation tests only

### Performance Impact
- Initial container startup: ~5-10 seconds
- Subsequent test runs: Minimal overhead
- Tests share container via collection fixture
- Automatic cleanup after test completion

## Key Learnings

1. **In-Memory Database Limitations**
   - Hides real database constraints
   - Doesn't enforce foreign keys properly
   - Allows invalid configurations
   - No timezone enforcement

2. **EF Core Limitations**
   - Cannot configure nullable owned entities with required properties
   - Requires workarounds for complex domain models
   - Strict about DateTime timezone handling with PostgreSQL

3. **Entity Design Requirements**
   - Always initialize Id in constructors
   - Use UTC for all DateTime values
   - Consider EF Core limitations when designing value objects
   - Test data must be unique for parallel execution

## Migration Guide

A comprehensive migration guide has been created at:
`/tests/WitchCityRope.IntegrationTests/MIGRATION_TO_POSTGRESQL.md`

This guide includes:
- Step-by-step migration instructions
- Common pitfalls and solutions
- Code examples for each issue
- Troubleshooting tips

## Recommendations

1. **Always Use Real Database for Integration Tests**
   - In-memory provider should only be used for unit tests
   - Real database reveals actual constraint violations
   - Better confidence in production behavior

2. **Entity Framework Core Best Practices**
   - Avoid nullable owned entities with required properties
   - Always use UTC DateTime values
   - Initialize all required fields in constructors
   - Test with real database during development

3. **Test Data Management**
   - Always use unique values (GUIDs) for test data
   - Consider test data builders for consistency
   - Clean up test data appropriately
   - Share expensive resources like database containers

While it required significant effort, the increased test reliability and bug discovery justified the investment. Future development will benefit from more accurate testing that reflects real production behavior.
