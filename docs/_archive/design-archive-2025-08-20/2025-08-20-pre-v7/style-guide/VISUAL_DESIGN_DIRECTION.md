   - Mobile-first responsive approach

4. **Photography Guidelines:**
   - Warm, natural lighting
   - Focus on hands, connection, and process

   - 60% instructional, 40% community/lifestyle
   - Consistent warm filter/LUT applied

5. **Illustration Style:**

## UI Component Styling

### Buttons
```css
/* Primary Button */

- Text: White
- Hover: Slight glow effect
- Active: Pressed shadow
- Rounded corners: 8px

/* Secondary Button */

```

### Cards
```css

```

### Forms
```css

```

## Motion & Interaction

- **Transitions:** Smooth, 200-300ms
- **Hover effects:** Subtle lift or glow
- **Loading:** Rope-inspired spinner animation
- **Page transitions:** Fade with slight scale

## Accessibility Considerations

- Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios
- Include focus states for all interactive elements
- Use color + icon for status indicators
- Provide text alternatives for decorative elements

## Implementation Notes

1. Start with the color palette and typography
2. Create component library with these styles
3. Build pattern library for reusable elements
4. Develop photography style guide
5. Create icon set with rope motifs

This design direction creates a warm, sophisticated, and approachable visual identity that reflects the community's values while standing out in the digital landscape.
