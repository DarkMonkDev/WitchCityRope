# Progress Log - January 11, 2025 - Blocked Status

## Current Situation

### Work Blocked Due to Active Development
- Another developer is currently standardizing forms and validation in the Web project
- This is causing build errors in components like:
  - VettingApplicationStandardized.razor (AuthenticatedUser type issue)
  - WcrInputRadio.razor (type conversion errors)
  - Various validation components

### Build Errors Encountered
```
- CS0246: 'AuthenticatedUser' could not be found
- CS1503: Argument 1: cannot convert from 'string' to 'TValue'
- CS0117: 'VettingApplicationDto' does not contain definitions for various properties
```

### Decision
- **WAIT** until form standardization work is complete
- Do not create new component tests that might conflict with ongoing changes
- Do not modify existing components to "fix" errors that are part of active refactoring

### What's Ready for Future Work
✅ Test infrastructure is complete and clean:
- All helpers properly reference existing types
- No unauthorized dependencies (MudBlazor removed)
- Authentication helpers ready
- Service mocking utilities ready
- Navigation testing helpers ready

✅ Example tests demonstrate patterns:
- LoginTests.cs (8 tests)
- MainLayoutTests.cs (24 tests)

### Next Steps (When Unblocked)
1. Wait for form standardization to complete
2. Ensure Web project builds successfully
3. Resume component testing starting with:
   - Registration component tests
   - Event list component tests
   - Member dashboard tests
   - Service integration tests

### Recommendation
The test infrastructure is solid and ready. Once the form standardization is complete and the Web project builds cleanly, testing can resume immediately using the established patterns and infrastructure.
