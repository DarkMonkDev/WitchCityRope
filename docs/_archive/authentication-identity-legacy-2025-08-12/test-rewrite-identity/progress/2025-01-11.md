# Progress Log - January 11, 2025

## Session Overview
Started the Web test rewrite project after discovering 318+ compilation errors in the existing test suite.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Initial Analysis
- Identified that existing Web tests are incompatible with current architecture
- Found major issues:
  - Service interface methods don't match (e.g., `GetProfileAsync` vs `GetCurrentUserProfileAsync`)
  - Missing extension methods (`GetClasses`, `AddSyncfusionBlazor`)
  - Type ambiguities between Pages and DTOs
  - Tests written for old authentication system

### 2. Documentation Setup
- Created enhancement folder structure at `/docs/enhancements/test-rewrite-identity/`
- Documented project overview and goals
- Created comprehensive test plan covering all test categories
- Documented Blazor testing best practices for .NET 9

### 3. Decision Made
- Complete rewrite is more efficient than fixing 318+ errors
- Focus on testing ASP.NET Core Identity integration
- Follow current service contracts and architecture

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Create new test project structure
2. Set up base test classes and helpers
3. Implement authentication test utilities
4. Start with high-priority component tests

### Infrastructure Setup Needed
- [ ] Create `TestAuthenticationContext` for Identity testing
- [ ] Create `ComponentTestBase` with proper service registration
- [ ] Create test data builders for common entities
- [ ] Set up mock service helpers
- [ ] Configure test-specific appsettings

### Priority Components to Test First
1. Login component (Auth/Login.razor)
2. MainLayout (Shared/Layouts/MainLayout.razor)
3. Event list (Features/Events/EventList.razor)
4. Member dashboard (Features/Members/Pages/Dashboard.razor)

## Technical Notes

### Service Interfaces to Mock
```csharp
// Current Web service interfaces that need mocking:
- IAuthService (custom service for auth operations)
- IEventService (GetUpcomingEventsAsync, GetEventDetailAsync, RegisterForEventAsync)
- IUserService (GetCurrentUserProfileAsync, UpdateProfileAsync)
- IRegistrationService (GetMyRegistrationsAsync, CancelRegistrationAsync)
- INotificationService (GetNotificationsAsync, MarkNotificationAsReadAsync)
- IToastService (ShowSuccess, ShowError, ShowWarning, ShowInfo)
```

### Identity Integration Points
- UserManager<WitchCityRopeUser>
- SignInManager<WitchCityRopeUser>
- RoleManager<IdentityRole<Guid>>
- IUserClaimsPrincipalFactory<WitchCityRopeUser>

### Test Data Considerations
- Use IdentityUserBuilder for creating test users
- Mock JWT token generation for API tests
- Set up test roles: Admin, Teacher, Member, Vetted, Attendee

## Blockers/Issues
- None currently, ready to proceed with implementation

## Time Estimate
- Infrastructure setup: 2-3 hours
- Component tests: 8-10 hours
- Service tests: 4-6 hours
- Integration tests: 4-6 hours
- Total: ~20-25 hours for 80% coverage

## Notes for Next Developer
1. Start by creating the test infrastructure in a clean namespace
2. Use the existing `WitchCityRope.Tests.Common` project for shared builders
3. Follow the patterns in `best-practices.md` for consistency
4. Run coverage reports frequently to track progress
5. Focus on user-facing functionality over implementation details
