# SendGrid Configuration Fix

## Issue
Login was failing with error:
```
System.ArgumentNullException: 'Value cannot be null. (Parameter 'apiKey')'
```

## Root Cause
Multiple configuration mismatches:
1. `DependencyInjection.cs` was looking for `SendGrid:ApiKey` but configuration has `Email:SendGrid:ApiKey`
2. `EmailService.cs` was looking for `SendGrid:FromEmail` but configuration has `Email:From`
3. SendGrid client was required even when API key wasn't configured

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated DependencyInjection.cs
Changed from:
```csharp
services.AddSendGrid(options =>
{
    options.ApiKey = configuration["SendGrid:ApiKey"];
});
```

To:
```csharp
var sendGridApiKey = configuration["Email:SendGrid:ApiKey"];
if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(sendGridApiKey))
{
    services.AddSendGrid(options =>
    {
        options.ApiKey = sendGridApiKey;
    });
}
```

### 2. Updated EmailService.cs Configuration Paths
Changed from:
- `SendGrid:FromEmail` → `Email:From`
- `SendGrid:FromName` → `Email:FromName`
- `SendGrid:Templates:*` → `Email:SendGrid:Templates:*`

### 3. Made EmailService Handle Null SendGridClient
- Changed `ISendGridClient` to `ISendGridClient?` (nullable)
- Added null checks in all email methods
- When SendGrid is not configured, emails are logged to console instead

## Result
The application now works without SendGrid configured, which is perfect for development. In production, configure the SendGrid API key in the Email:SendGrid:ApiKey configuration.

## Development Mode
When SendGrid is not configured:
- Emails are logged to console with format: `[EMAIL] To: {email}, Subject: {subject}`
- All email operations return success
- No actual emails are sent

## Production Configuration
To enable real email sending, add to appsettings.json:
```json
"Email": {
  "SendGrid": {
    "ApiKey": "YOUR_ACTUAL_SENDGRID_API_KEY"
  }
}
```
