# Login Navigation Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for enhancing the login system and post-login navigation based on user roles, ensuring proper role-based menu visibility and comprehensive testing.

## Objectives
1. Verify and enhance post-login navigation showing role-appropriate menu items
2. Ensure proper navigation to user dashboard after login
3. Show admin dashboard link only for administrators
4. Implement comprehensive tests for all user role scenarios
5. Verify UI matches wireframe designs

## Current State Analysis

### Authentication System
- **Technology**: JWT-based API auth + Cookie-based Blazor auth
- **User Roles**: Attendee, Member, Organizer, Moderator, Administrator
- **Test Accounts Available**:
  - admin@witchcityrope.com (Administrator)
  - staff@witchcityrope.com (Moderator)
  - member@witchcityrope.com (Member)
  - guest@witchcityrope.com (Attendee)
  - organizer@witchcityrope.com (Moderator)

### Navigation Components
- **Primary**: MainLayout.razor with role-based menu items
- **Admin**: AdminLayout.razor for admin panel
- **Mobile**: Responsive mobile menu implementation

### Post-Login Flow
1. User logs in via `/auth/login`
2. On success, redirected to `/member/dashboard` (or returnUrl)
3. Navigation updates to show authenticated menu items

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis and Verification
- [ ] Review current MainLayout navigation implementation
- [ ] Check role-based menu visibility logic
- [ ] Verify navigation updates after login
- [ ] Compare current UI with wireframes

### Phase 2: Code Enhancement
- [ ] Fix any role-based navigation issues in MainLayout
- [ ] Ensure proper menu items appear for each role:
  - All authenticated: My Profile, My Tickets, Settings, Logout
  - Admin only: Admin Panel link
- [ ] Verify navigation state updates immediately after login

### Phase 3: Test Implementation
- [ ] Create LoginNavigationTests.cs with scenarios for each role
- [ ] Test login flow for all test accounts
- [ ] Verify navigation menu changes post-login
- [ ] Test navigation to dashboard pages
- [ ] Verify page content matches wireframes

### Phase 4: Documentation
- [ ] Document test results
- [ ] Create user guide for navigation features
- [ ] Update any relevant documentation

## Success Criteria
1. Users see appropriate navigation menu items based on their role
2. Navigation updates immediately after login without page refresh
3. All navigation links work and lead to correct pages
4. Pages match wireframe designs
5. All tests pass for different user roles
6. No regression in existing functionality

## Timeline
- Phase 1: 30 minutes
- Phase 2: 1 hour
- Phase 3: 2 hours
- Phase 4: 30 minutes
Total estimated time: 4 hours
