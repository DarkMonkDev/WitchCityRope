# Login Flow Test Report

## Test Execution Summary

The Puppeteer test script was executed to verify the login flow and navigation menu state changes in WitchCityRope application running on Docker at localhost:5651.

## Step-by-Step Results

### Step 1: Navigate to Homepage ✓
- Successfully navigated to http://localhost:5651
- Homepage loaded with status: networkidle0
- Screenshot: `01-homepage.png`

### Step 2: Check Initial Navigation State ✓
- LOGIN button found in navigation
- Button text: "Login"
- Button URL: http://localhost:5651/login
- Navigation menu correctly shows LOGIN button for unauthenticated users

### Step 3: Click LOGIN Button ⚠️
- Issue: Click event on the LOGIN button failed
- Fallback: Direct navigation to /login URL was used instead
- Screenshot: `02-login-page-direct.png`

### Step 4: Fill Login Credentials ✓
- Successfully filled email field with: admin@witchcityrope.com
- Successfully filled password field with: Test123!
- Screenshot: `03-credentials-filled.png`

### Step 5: Submit Login Form ✓
- Submit button was clicked
- Form submission initiated

### Step 6: Wait for Navigation ⚠️
- Navigation after login timed out after 10 seconds
- Current URL remained at: http://localhost:5651/identity/account/login
- This suggests the login form submission didn't redirect properly

### Step 7: Check Navigation Menu Update ❌
- Navigation menu did NOT update after login attempt
- User menu elements not found
- LOGIN button still present in navigation
- Navigation content: "WITCH CITY ROPE EVENTS & CLASSES HOW TO JOIN RESOURCES LOGIN"
- No user-specific menu items (Dashboard, Profile, Logout) were detected

### Step 8: Navigate to Dashboard ⚠️
- Attempted to navigate to /member/dashboard
- URL: http://localhost:5651/member/dashboard

### Step 9: Check Dashboard Load ❌
- Dashboard did NOT load properly
- Current URL is not /member/dashboard (likely redirected to login)
- Page title: "Login - Witch City Rope"
- No dashboard-specific elements found
- Page appears to still be on the login page

### Step 10: Final Screenshot ✓
- Full page screenshot captured
- Screenshot: `06-final-state.png`

## Issues Identified

1. **Login Form Submission**: The login form submission doesn't appear to be working correctly. After submitting credentials, the page remains on the login URL instead of redirecting to a authenticated area.

2. **Authentication State**: The authentication state is not being properly established or maintained, as evidenced by:
   - Navigation menu not updating to show user menu
   - Unable to access protected routes like /member/dashboard
   - Being redirected back to login page

3. **Navigation Click Handler**: The LOGIN button click handler failed, requiring direct navigation as a fallback.

4. **API Integration**: The login form might not be properly integrated with the backend API, or there could be issues with:
   - JWT token generation/storage
   - Cookie setting
   - Session management
   - CORS configuration

## Recommendations

1. **Check API Endpoints**: Verify that the login API endpoint is properly configured and accessible from the frontend.

2. **Debug Authentication Flow**: Add console logging to track:
   - API request/response
   - Token storage (localStorage/cookies)
   - Authentication state updates

3. **Verify Form Configuration**: Ensure the login form is properly configured with:
   - Correct API endpoint
   - Proper request headers
   - Correct data format (JSON vs form-data)

4. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors or failed network requests during login.

5. **Test API Directly**: Use tools like curl or Postman to verify the login API works correctly with the test credentials.
