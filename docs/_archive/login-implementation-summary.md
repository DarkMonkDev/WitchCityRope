# WitchCityRope Login Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Login Page Design Updates ✅
- Updated `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Features/Auth/Pages/Login.razor` to match the wireframe design
- Applied gradient backgrounds (midnight to charcoal)
- Styled amber CTA buttons with hover effects
- Added age verification notice: "21+ COMMUNITY • AGE VERIFICATION REQUIRED"
- Implemented tab navigation between Sign In and Create Account
- Added Google OAuth button with proper styling
- Applied all color scheme requirements from wireframe

### 2. Authentication System Review ✅
- **Architecture**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Components**:
  - `AuthenticationService`: Handles JWT token management and localStorage
  - `ServerAuthenticationStateProvider`: Manages server-side auth state
  - `AuthService`: Provides high-level auth operations
- **Cookie Authentication**: Configured but currently using JWT for API calls
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper user and authentication tables

### 3. Docker Configuration ✅
- Fixed HTTPS issues by using HTTP-only in Docker containers
- Ensured all containers use the same database (witchcityrope_db)
- Fixed dependency injection issues (SendGrid, etc.)
- Database is automatically seeded with test users on API startup

### 4. Database Setup ✅
- Applied all migrations successfully
- Database seeded with test accounts:
  - admin@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Administrator)
  - member@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Regular member)
  - organizer@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Event organizer)
  - staff@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Staff member)
  - guest@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Guest)

### 5. API Authentication ✅
- API login endpoint working correctly at `/api/identity/account/login`
- Returns JWT token, refresh token, and user information
- Token includes proper claims (UserId, SceneName, role, etc.)

## Current State

### Working:
1. ✅ Docker containers all running (web, api, postgres)
2. ✅ Database properly initialized with test data
3. ✅ API authentication endpoints functioning
4. ✅ Login page styled according to wireframe
5. ✅ Navigation structure in place

### Authentication Flow:
1. User enters credentials on login page
2. Blazor component calls `AuthService.LoginAsync()`
3. AuthService calls API endpoint `/api/identity/account/login`
4. API validates credentials and returns JWT token
5. Token stored in localStorage
6. Navigation forced to reload with `forceLoad: true`
7. Authentication state should be picked up on reload

## Known Issues

### 1. Authentication State Persistence
The user reported that after logging in:
- Login appears to succeed (no error shown)
- User is cycled back to login page
- Navigation menu doesn't show authenticated options (username, dashboard, logout)

This suggests the authentication state isn't being properly propagated after login, despite the JWT token being received.

### 2. Health Check Conflict
Minor issue with duplicate health check endpoints causing ambiguous routing errors in logs.

## Test Results

Created `test-login.sh` script that verified:
- ✅ API health check: Healthy
- ✅ Web app accessible: HTTP 200
- ✅ API login: Successfully returns JWT token
- ✅ Database users: All test accounts present

## Next Steps for Full Resolution

1. **Browser Testing**: Need proper browser automation tools to test the full UI flow
2. **Debug Authentication State**: Add more logging to understand why auth state isn't persisting
3. **SignalR Circuit**: Verify Blazor SignalR circuit is properly handling authentication state
4. **Cookie vs JWT**: Possibly need to align cookie authentication with JWT for Blazor Server
