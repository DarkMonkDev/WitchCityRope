# Login Functionality Test Report

## Summary

I've tested the login functionality of the WitchCityRope application. While I couldn't use the Stagehand MCP browser automation tool (it's not available in this environment), I was able to verify the login page structure and functionality through HTTP requests and code analysis.

## Test Results

### 1. Login Page Accessibility ✅
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5651/identity/account/login`
- **Status**: The login page is accessible and returns a 200 OK response
- **Note**: The `/login` endpoint redirects to `/identity/account/login` which is the actual Blazor component

### 2. Google OAuth Button ✅
- **Present**: Yes, the Google OAuth button is present on the login page
- **Styling**: 
  - Button has class `btn-google`
  - Contains Google icon SVG with proper colors
  - Text displays "Continue with Google"
  - Styled with proper spacing and shadow effects

### 3. Form Elements ✅
- **Email Field**: Present with ID `login-email` and label "Email Address"
- **Password Field**: Present with ID `login-password` and label "Password"
- **Remember Me**: Checkbox present with text "Keep me signed in for 30 days"
- **Sign In Button**: Present with class `btn-primary-full`

### 4. Test Credentials ❌
- **Credentials**: admin@witchcityrope.com / Test123!
- **Issue**: The database hasn't been migrated/seeded yet
- **API Response**: 400 Bad Request when attempting login
- **Reason**: The Users table doesn't exist in the database

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Blazor Server-Side application running on port 5651
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core API (configured to run on port 8080 in Docker)
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (not yet initialized)

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials on the Blazor login page
2. Blazor app sends credentials to `/api/identity/account/login` endpoint
3. API validates credentials against the database
4. If successful, API returns JWT token and refresh token
5. Blazor app stores tokens and redirects to dashboard
6. Google OAuth redirects to `/api/auth/google-login` endpoint

### Seeded Test Accounts (When Database is Initialized)
- admin@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Administrator role)
- staff@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Moderator role)
- organizer@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Moderator role)
- member@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Member role)
- guest@witchcityrope.com / Test123! (Attendee role)

## Issues Found

1. **Database Not Initialized**: The PostgreSQL database needs to be migrated before login can work
2. **API Configuration**: The Web app is configured to connect to `http://api:8080` (Docker setup) rather than a local API endpoint
3. **Missing Migrations**: Need to run Entity Framework migrations to create the database schema

## Recommendations

1. **Initialize Database**:
   ```bash
   cd src/WitchCityRope.Api
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

2. **Seed Test Data**:
   ```bash
   cd tools/DatabaseSeeder
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Update API Configuration**: For local development, update the `ApiUrl` in the Web app's configuration to point to the correct API endpoint

4. **Browser Testing**: Once the database is initialized, use automated browser testing tools like Playwright or Selenium for comprehensive UI testing

## Screenshots Alternative

Since I couldn't take actual screenshots, here's what you would see:

### Login Page Elements:
- Clean, modern design with WitchCity Rope branding
- Centered login form with tab navigation (Sign In / Create Account)
- Google OAuth button prominently displayed at the top
- Email and password fields with proper labels
- Remember me checkbox
- Sign In button styled as primary action
- "Forgot your password?" link at the bottom
- Age verification notice: "21+ COMMUNITY • AGE VERIFICATION REQUIRED"

### Navigation Menu (Unauthenticated):
- Logo: "WITCH CITY ROPE"
- Menu items: Events & Classes, How To Join, Resources
- Login button in the navigation bar
- Utility bar with "Report an Incident" and "Private Lessons" links

The login page appears to be well-designed and follows modern UI/UX patterns. Once the database is properly initialized, the login functionality should work as expected.
