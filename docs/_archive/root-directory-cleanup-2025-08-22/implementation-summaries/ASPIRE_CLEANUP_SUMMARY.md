### Aspire Project Status

The `WitchCityRope.AppHost` and `WitchCityRope.ServiceDefaults` projects were not found in the src directory, indicating they have already been removed or were never created.

### Summary

All Aspire-related documentation, scripts, and references have been successfully removed from the project. The project now focuses on two deployment methods:
1. Direct launch using `dotnet run`
2. Docker Compose for containerized development

The cleanup ensures no confusion about deprecated Aspire orchestration and simplifies the development workflow.
