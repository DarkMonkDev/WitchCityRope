## Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Master Preparation âœ…
- [x] Switch to master
- [x] Create backup tag: pre-merge-backup-2025-08-22

### Phase 2: Core Pages (Highest Priority) âœ…
- [x] Switch to feature/2025-08-22-core-pages-implementation
- [x] Merge master into feature branch (resolve conflicts locally)
- [x] Switch to master
- [x] Merge feature branch into master
- [x] Test basic functionality

### Phase 3: Database Auto-Init Branch âœ…
- [x] Switch to feature/2025-08-22-database-auto-initialization
- [x] Merge master into feature branch (fast-forward)
- [x] Switch to master  
- [x] Merge feature branch into master (already up to date)

### Phase 4: User Dashboard Redesign Branch âœ…
- [x] Switch to feature/2025-08-22-user-dashboard-redesign
- [x] Merge master into feature branch (fast-forward merge)
- [x] Switch to master
- [x] Merge feature branch into master (already up to date)

### Phase 5: API Architecture âœ…
- [x] Switch to feature/2025-08-22-api-architecture-modernization
- [x] Merge master into feature branch (resolved conflicts)
- [x] Switch to master
- [x] Merge feature branch into master (fast-forward)

### Phase 6: Final Steps âœ…
- [x] Create post-merge tag: post-frontend-merge-2025-08-22
- [x] Push everything to origin
- [x] Clean up local feature branches
- [x] Document what was merged

## Safety Measures
- Backup tag created before any operations
- Each branch merged into master after resolving conflicts locally first
- Testing between major merges
- Comprehensive documentation of all changes
- Push tags and master to remote for backup

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Merge conflicts between branches
- **Mitigation**: Merge master into feature branches first to resolve locally âœ… COMPLETED

- **Risk**: Breaking changes during merge
- **Mitigation**: Test basic functionality after each major merge âœ… COMPLETED

- **Risk**: Loss of work
- **Mitigation**: Backup tags + push to remote frequently âœ… COMPLETED

## Recovery Plan
If issues occur:
1. Use `git reset --hard pre-merge-backup-2025-08-22` to restore to pre-merge state
2. Examine conflicts and plan alternative merge strategy
3. Cherry-pick specific commits if needed

## Progress Log
- **Phase 1**: âœ… Completed - Master preparation and backup tag created
- **Phase 2**: âœ… Completed - Core pages implementation merged successfully
- **Phase 3**: âœ… Completed - Database auto-initialization synchronized 
- **Phase 4**: âœ… Completed - User dashboard redesign synchronized
- **Phase 5**: âœ… Completed - API architecture modernization merged with conflict resolution
- **Phase 6**: âœ… Completed - Final cleanup and push to origin

## Merge Results Summary
- **core-pages-implementation**: Successfully merged major dashboard implementation
- **database-auto-initialization**: Fast-forward synchronized (no conflicts)
