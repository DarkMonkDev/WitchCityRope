# Worktree Removal Archive - September 12, 2025

## Archive Purpose

This archive contains documentation related to git worktrees that were completely removed from the WitchCityRope project on September 12, 2025.

## Why Worktrees Were Removed

**Root Cause**: Git worktrees were found to be incompatible with Docker development workflow. Docker containers could not access files in worktree directories, causing development confusion and scattered work.

**Decision**: After the critical git crisis on September 10, 2025, the decision was made to abandon worktrees completely and use standard feature branches instead.
