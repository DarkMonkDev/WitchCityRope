# CRITICAL GIT CRISIS - September 10, 2025

<!-- Last Updated: 2025-09-10 -->
<!-- Version: 1.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Librarian Agent -->
<!-- Status: CRITICAL -->

## üö® CRITICAL SITUATION SUMMARY

**DISCOVERY**: Docker development environment runs from main directory but cannot see worktree changes, creating a massive git crisis with work scattered across multiple locations.

**IMMEDIATE IMPACT**: 
- Work done in main (Docker visible) while believing we were in worktrees
- 81 files initially staged, reduced to 26 after cleanup
- Critical fixes made today may be lost or scattered
- Docker/worktree incompatibility breaking development workflow

## üìä CURRENT GIT STATE (2025-09-10 04:15)

### Staged Files Count: 26 (After Cleanup)
**Original**: 81 files staged ‚Üí **Cleaned**: 26 legitimate changes remain

### Repository Locations
1. **Main Branch**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react` (commit 8864d0b)
2. **Events Worktree**: `.worktrees/feature-2025-08-24-events-management` (commit 2290bf3) - 1000+ file divergence
3. **User Management Worktree**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-2025-08-12-user-management-redesign` (detached HEAD 7e16705)

### Stashes Containing Potential Work
```
stash@{0}: WIP on feature/2025-08-22-user-dashboard-redesign: b6316cc
stash@{1}: On feature/2025-08-22-database-auto-initialization: [database work]
stash@{2}: On feature/2025-08-22-core-pages-implementation: [core pages work]
```

## üîß CRITICAL FIXES MADE TODAY

### 1. Database Schema Mismatch Resolution
- **File**: `apps/api/Data/ApplicationDbContext.cs`
- **Issue**: Database model out of sync
- **Fix**: Schema regeneration and migration update
- **Status**: STAGED IN MAIN

### 2. Events Display Fix
- **Files**: 
  - `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/EventsWidget.tsx`
  - `apps/web/src/components/homepage/EventsList.tsx`
- **Issue**: Events not displaying properly
- **Fix**: Data fetching and rendering corrections
- **Status**: STAGED IN MAIN

### 3. Login 400 Error Resolution
- **Files**: 
  - `apps/web/src/stores/authStore.ts`
  - `apps/api/Features/Events/Endpoints/EventEndpoints.cs`
- **Issue**: Authentication failing with 400 errors
- **Fix**: Request format and endpoint corrections
- **Status**: STAGED IN MAIN

### 4. Dashboard RangeError Fix
- **File**: `apps/web/src/components/dashboard/EventsWidget.tsx`
- **Issue**: JavaScript RangeError breaking dashboard
- **Fix**: Array handling and boundary checks
- **Status**: STAGED IN MAIN

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Docker Limitation Discovery
```bash
# THIS WORKS (main directory visible to Docker)
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
./dev.sh

# THIS FAILS (worktree not visible to Docker)
cd .worktrees/feature-2025-08-24-events-management
./dev.sh  # Docker can't mount worktree paths
```

### Workflow Violation Pattern
1. Create worktree for feature work
2. Navigate to main for Docker commands
3. **STAY IN MAIN** and work (thinking we're in worktree)
4. Commit to main instead of feature branch
5. Worktrees become stale/detached

## üìÅ FILES CLEANED UP (Build Artifacts Removed)

### Removed from Staging
- `apps/web/dist/` build outputs
- `apps/api/bin/` compiled binaries  
- `apps/api/obj/` build cache
- Node modules artifacts
- Test result files
- Temporary files

### Kept in Staging (Legitimate Changes)
- Source code modifications (26 files)
- Configuration updates
- Documentation updates
- Schema migrations

## üö® IMMEDIATE DANGERS

1. **Work Loss Risk**: Critical fixes scattered across locations
2. **Merge Conflicts**: Worktrees significantly diverged from main
3. **Docker Development Broken**: Can't develop in worktrees
4. **Branch Integrity**: Main contains feature work
5. **Stash Risk**: Important work may be in stashes

## üìã KNOWN WORKTREE STATES

### Events Worktree (1000+ file divergence)
- **Location**: `.worktrees/feature-2025-08-24-events-management`
- **Status**: Significantly diverged from main
- **Risk**: May contain unique implementation

### User Management Worktree (Detached HEAD)
- **Location**: `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-worktrees/feature-2025-08-12-user-management-redesign`
- **Status**: Detached HEAD state
- **Risk**: Work may be unreachable

## üîß SYSTEMIC ISSUES IDENTIFIED

1. **Docker/Worktree Incompatibility**: Core workflow broken
2. **No Validation Scripts**: No check for worktree vs main work
3. **Missing Handoff Process**: No documentation of worktree states
4. **Branch Strategy Confusion**: Multiple parallel feature branches

## üìù DOCUMENTATION CREATED TODAY

### Prevention Documents
- `docs/standards-processes/worktree-workflow-standard.md` - New workflow rules
- `docs/standards-processes/worktree-validation-script.sh` - Validation automation
- `docs/lessons-learned/CRITICAL-worktree-violation-2025-09-10.md` - Issue analysis
- `docs/lessons-learned/WORKTREE-VIOLATION-PREVENTION-SUMMARY.md` - Prevention summary

### Agent Updates
- Updated multiple agent lessons learned files with worktree awareness
- Enhanced continuation guides with worktree validation
- Added Docker limitations to development documentation

## üöÄ NEXT STEPS REQUIRED

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Execute recovery plan (see RECOVERY-PLAN.md)
2. **URGENT**: Commit staged changes safely
3. **CRITICAL**: Extract work from worktrees
4. **ESSENTIAL**: Implement prevention measures

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- [ ] All 26 staged changes committed safely
- [ ] Worktree work consolidated into main
- [ ] Docker development workflow restored
- [ ] Prevention measures implemented
- [ ] No work lost during recovery

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

- **DO NOT** create new worktrees until workflow fixed
- **DO NOT** use Docker commands in worktree directories
- **DO NOT** abandon stashes without inspection
- **ALWAYS** validate location before development work

---

**URGENCY**: CRITICAL - Immediate action required
**IMPACT**: High - Core development workflow broken
**COMPLEXITY**: High - Multiple locations with scattered work
