3. **Event Display**:
   - ✅ Suspended/denied members filtered at service layer
   - ✅ Sliding scale pricing display

## What Still Needs Implementation

### 1. Backend Integration
- [ ] API endpoints for enhanced event model
- [ ] Vetting status API integration
- [ ] Event registration/RSVP endpoints
- [ ] Payment processing (placeholder ready)

### 2. Registration Flow
- [ ] Registration form/modal
- [ ] RSVP form for social events
- [ ] Payment integration
- [ ] Confirmation emails

### 3. Dashboard Integration
- [ ] Update dashboard to show registered events
- [ ] Add "My Events" section
- [ ] Event reminders

### 4. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for new Event methods
- [ ] Integration tests for vetting logic
- [ ] E2E tests for complete flow

## Code Quality

### SOLID Principles Applied
- **Single Responsibility**: Separate pages for admin/member functionality
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible event types and pricing models
- **Liskov Substitution**: Event types follow consistent interface
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Dependency Inversion**: Services injected, not instantiated

### Documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive XML comments on all public methods
- ✅ Clear variable and method names
- ✅ Implementation plans documented
- ✅ Test results recorded

## Testing Results

### Admin Event Edit

- ✅ Multi-tab interface renders correctly
- ✅ Form elements display properly
- ⚠️ Need test data to verify edit functionality

### Member Events Page
- ✅ Page loads for authenticated users
- ✅ Filters and search work
- ✅ Event cards display correctly
- ✅ Vetting messages appear
- ✅ Different buttons for different event types
- ⚠️ Mock data used - needs API integration

## Summary

- Comprehensive admin editing capabilities
- Member-facing event browsing with vetting awareness
- Clear business rule enforcement
- Well-documented, maintainable code

The foundation is solid and ready for backend integration to complete the full user experience.
