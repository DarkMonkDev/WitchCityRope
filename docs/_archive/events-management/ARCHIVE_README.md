## Consolidation Summary

All information from these documents has been consolidated into:
- `/docs/functional-areas/events-management/current-state/business-requirements.md`
- `/docs/functional-areas/events-management/current-state/functional-design.md`
- `/docs/functional-areas/events-management/current-state/user-flows.md`
- `/docs/functional-areas/events-management/current-state/test-coverage.md`
- `/docs/functional-areas/events-management/current-state/wireframes.md`

## Why Archived
These documents were archived because:
1. Multiple overlapping documents described the same functionality
2. Information was scattered across different folders
3. No clear versioning or ownership
4. Mix of implementation details with requirements
5. Duplicate content across multiple files

## Key Information Preserved
All critical information has been preserved in the new structure:
- Business rules about Classes vs Social Events
- RSVP vs Ticket distinction
- Vetting requirements
- Technical implementation details
- API endpoints and data models
- Test coverage information
