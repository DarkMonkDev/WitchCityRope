# Archive: 00-START-HERE.md Legacy Documentation
<!-- Archived: 2025-08-22 -->
<!-- Archived By: Librarian Agent -->
<!-- Reason: Navigation approach superseded -->

## Archive Reason

The 00-START-HERE.md navigation approach has been superseded by the **Functional Area Master Index** system. This change was necessary because:

1. **Master Index Superiority**: `/docs/architecture/functional-area-master-index.md` provides more precise, agent-focused navigation
2. **Root Docs Pollution Prevention**: Part of zero-tolerance policy for /docs/ root files
3. **Agent Efficiency**: Agents now receive exact paths directly from the master index
4. **Maintenance Overhead**: 00-START-HERE required constant updates for every new functional area

## What Was Preserved

**Navigation Structure**: Extracted to master index
**DTO Alignment Strategy Links**: Preserved in CLAUDE.md critical warnings  
**Role-Based Guidance**: Already exists in lessons-learned files
**Script Inventory Links**: Preserved in CLAUDE.md

## What Was Lost (Intentionally)

- Redundant navigation paths (duplicated master index content)
- Long-form role descriptions (agents have specific lessons-learned files)
- Verbose documentation structure diagrams (simplified in standards docs)

## Replacement Navigation

**Primary Navigation**: `/docs/architecture/functional-area-master-index.md`
**Agent Guidance**: `/.claude/agents/` + `/docs/lessons-learned/`
**Critical Warnings**: `/CLAUDE.md` (project root)
**Standards**: `/docs/standards-processes/`
