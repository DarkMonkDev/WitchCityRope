#### Session Management
- [ ] Configure secure session cookies:
  ```csharp
  options.Cookie.SecurePolicy = CookieSecurePolicy.Always;
  options.Cookie.SameSite = SameSiteMode.Strict;
  options.Cookie.HttpOnly = true;
  ```
- [ ] Set appropriate session timeout
- [ ] Implement sliding expiration
- [ ] Add "Remember Me" functionality
- [ ] Clear sessions on password change

### 🚀 Infrastructure Setup

#### Environment Variables
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET_KEY` - Production signing key

#### SSL/TLS Configuration
- [ ] Obtain SSL certificate for domain
- [ ] Configure HTTPS redirection
- [ ] Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- [ ] Set up certificate auto-renewal
- [ ] Configure TLS 1.2 minimum

#### Logging and Monitoring
- [ ] Configure production logging level (Warning)
- [ ] Set up centralized logging (ELK, Application Insights)
- [ ] Implement authentication event logging:
  - Successful logins
  - Failed login attempts
  - Password changes
  - Account lockouts
  - Token generation
- [ ] Set up alerts for:
  - High failure rates
  - Unusual login patterns
  - System errors
- [ ] Configure performance monitoring

### 📊 Database Migration

#### Data Migration
- [ ] Backup existing user data
- [ ] Map existing users to new schema
- [ ] Migrate password hashes if compatible
- [ ] Verify scene name uniqueness
- [ ] Test with subset first

#### Indexes and Performance
- [ ] Create index on Email column
- [ ] Create index on SceneName column
- [ ] Create index on LastLoginAt
- [ ] Analyze query execution plans
- [ ] Set up database monitoring

### 🧪 Testing Requirements

#### Security Testing
- [ ] Run OWASP ZAP security scan
- [ ] Perform penetration testing
- [ ] Test XSS protection
- [ ] Verify CSRF protection
- [ ] Test SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Validate JWT token security

#### Load Testing
- [ ] Test with expected user load
- [ ] Test login endpoint: 100 requests/second
- [ ] Test registration: 10 requests/second
- [ ] Monitor database connection pool
- [ ] Check memory usage patterns
- [ ] Verify auto-scaling triggers

#### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with production-like data
- [ ] Verify email service integration
- [ ] Test error handling and logging
- [ ] Verify monitoring alerts
- [ ] Test backup and restore procedures

### 📝 Documentation Updates

#### User Documentation
- [ ] Create password requirements guide
- [ ] Document account recovery process
- [ ] Write FAQ for common issues
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Update terms of service

#### Technical Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints with examples

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **JWT Key Exposure**: Use secure vault, never commit to code
2. **Database Credentials**: Encrypt and rotate regularly
3. **Rate Limiting Bypass**: Monitor for distributed attacks
4. **Session Hijacking**: Implement device fingerprinting
5. **Password Brute Force**: Strong lockout policy

### Rollback Plan
1. Keep previous authentication system running (if exists)
2. Database rollback scripts ready
3. DNS quick-switch capability
4. Previous version containers ready
5. Communication plan for users
