# Phase 1 Requirements Review - Vertical Slice Home Page
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-16 -->
<!-- Version: 2.0 -->
<!-- Owner: Librarian Agent -->
<!-- Status: Revised - Ready for Re-approval -->

## Revision 1 - Simplification Based on Feedback
**Date**: 2025-08-16  
**Time**: Post-initial completion  
**Status**: Requirements significantly simplified based on user feedback

### Summary of Major Changes
The vertical slice scope has been **dramatically simplified** from a production-ready feature to a **technical proof-of-concept** based on user feedback emphasizing the need for throwaway code to validate technology stack communication.

**Key Simplifications Applied**:
1. **Simplified from production feature to technical proof-of-concept**
   - Removed all production concerns (SEO, performance optimization, security headers)
   - Set explicit expectation that this will be **throwaway code**
   - Focus purely on technology stack validation

2. **Removed authentication and complex business rules**
   - No user authentication or authorization
   - No business logic validation
   - No user roles or permissions
   - Simple public endpoint only

3. **Progressive testing approach implemented**
   - **Step 1**: Hardcoded API response (prove React ↔ API communication)
   - **Step 2**: Database integration (prove API ↔ Database communication)
   - Clear progression from simple to complex

4. **Throwaway code expectation explicitly set**
   - Database entities will likely be discarded
   - Component structure is for testing only
   - Documentation of lessons learned is the primary deliverable

5. **Removed all production concerns**
   - No SEO optimization requirements
   - No performance optimization beyond basic functionality
   - No security hardening (basic XSS prevention only)
   - No scalability considerations
   - No accessibility requirements beyond basic HTML semantics

### Updated Scope Focus
**Primary Goal**: Validate technology stack communication (React ↔ API ↔ Database)  
**Secondary Goal**: Test the complete 5-phase development workflow with sub-agents  
**Tertiary Goal**: Document lessons learned for actual production implementation

**Success Criteria**: Stack communication works, workflow process validated, comprehensive lessons documented

### Alignment Status
✅ **Business Requirements (v2.0)**: Updated and aligned with simplified scope  
✅ **Functional Specification (v2.0)**: Updated and aligned with simplified scope  
✅ **Both documents**: Now consistently focused on technical proof-of-concept

## Key Decisions Made

### Technology Stack Decisions
✅ **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 + TypeScript + Vite  
✅ **UI Library**: Chakra UI 3.24.2 with WitchCityRope theming  
✅ **State Management**: TanStack Query 5.85.3 + Zustand 5.0.7  
✅ **HTTP Client**: Axios 1.11.0 with interceptors  
✅ **Backend**: .NET 9 Minimal API with Entity Framework Core  
✅ **Database**: PostgreSQL with proper indexing strategy  

### Architecture Decisions
✅ **Microservices Pattern**: Web+API separation (React → HTTP → API → Database)  
✅ **Component Structure**: HomePage → EventsList → EventCard hierarchy  
✅ **Error Handling**: React Error Boundaries + graceful API error states  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Chakra UI breakpoints  
✅ **Performance**: TanStack Query caching + API response caching  

### Scope Decisions (Revised)
✅ **Technical Proof-of-Concept**: Throwaway code for stack validation only  
✅ **Progressive Testing**: Hardcoded → Database integration approach  
✅ **No Authentication**: Public endpoint with zero auth complexity  
✅ **No Production Concerns**: No SEO, performance optimization, or security hardening  
✅ **Simple Event Display**: Basic card layout for communication testing  
✅ **Lessons Learned Focus**: Primary deliverable is documentation of what we learn  

### Quality Standards Decisions (Simplified)
✅ **Basic Test Coverage**: Functional testing for stack communication  
✅ **Basic Performance**: Page loads and displays data (no optimization targets)  
✅ **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, ESLint, Prettier (unchanged)  
✅ **Minimal Documentation**: API endpoint documentation and basic component notes  
✅ **Basic Security**: XSS prevention only (no security headers or hardening)
