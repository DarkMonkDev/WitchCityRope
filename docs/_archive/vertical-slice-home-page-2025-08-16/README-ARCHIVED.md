# Vertical Slice Home Page - ARCHIVED

**Archived Date**: 2025-08-19  
**Archived By**: Librarian Agent  
**Original Location**: `/docs/functional-areas/vertical-slice-home-page/`  
**Archive Reason**: Project completed successfully, all value extracted  

## Archive Summary

This vertical slice project was successfully completed on 2025-08-16 with a 100% success rate. The project served as a proof-of-concept to validate:

- React + TypeScript + .NET API + PostgreSQL architecture
- Hybrid JWT + HttpOnly Cookies authentication pattern
- 5-phase AI workflow orchestration process
- Multi-agent coordination patterns

## Critical Information Extracted

All valuable patterns and lessons have been extracted to permanent locations:

### Authentication Patterns → `/docs/functional-areas/authentication/`
- **API Authentication Patterns**: Complete working endpoints and security patterns
- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step production implementation
- **Cost Analysis**: $6,600+ annual savings vs commercial alternatives
- **Performance Benchmarks**: 94-98% faster than targets

### Workflow Validation → `/docs/standards-processes/`
- **5-Phase Process**: Proven effective for complex development work
- **Quality Gates**: All phases exceeded success targets
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Successful patterns documented

## Key Achievements Preserved

✅ **Technical Validation**: React ↔ API ↔ PostgreSQL proven working  
✅ **Authentication Security**: XSS/CSRF protection validated  
✅ **Performance Excellence**: 94-98% faster than requirements  
✅ **Cost Effectiveness**: $0/month vs $550+/month alternatives  
✅ **Workflow Process**: 5-phase development proven effective  

## Current Status: COMPLETE

This project accomplished its mission of validating architectural patterns before production implementation. All valuable discoveries are preserved in appropriate functional areas for production use.
