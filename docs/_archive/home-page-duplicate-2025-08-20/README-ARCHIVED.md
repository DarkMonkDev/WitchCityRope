# Archive Notice: Home Page Duplicate Folder
<!-- Archived: 2025-08-20 -->
<!-- Archive Reason: Duplicate functional area cleanup -->
<!-- Librarian: Librarian Agent -->
<!-- Replacement: /docs/functional-areas/homepage/ -->

## Archive Reason
This folder was a duplicate of the proper `/docs/functional-areas/homepage/` functional area. It contained remnants from the vertical slice project that was already successfully archived in 2025-08-19.

## Content Summary
The archived folder contained:
- `after-login.png` - Screenshot from vertical slice testing
- `new-work/2025-08-16/testing/lint-validation.md` - Lint validation report from vertical slice project

## Value Extraction Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All valuable information was already extracted during the vertical slice archival process on 2025-08-19.

### Content Disposition
1. **Lint Validation Report**: The comprehensive lint validation patterns and quality gate processes are already preserved in:
   - `/docs/standards-processes/quality-gates/lint-validation-process.md`
   - Vertical slice archive: `/docs/_archive/vertical-slice-home-page-2025-08-16/`
   
2. **Screenshot**: The after-login.png file was part of vertical slice testing and is not needed for current homepage development.

## Replacement Location
**Active Development**: All homepage-related work should use the proper functional area at:
- **Base Path**: `/docs/functional-areas/homepage/`
- **Current Structure**: Complete 6-phase workflow folders (requirements/, design/, implementation/, testing/, reviews/, lessons-learned/)
- **Design Assets**: Homepage wireframes at `/docs/functional-areas/homepage/design/landing-page-visual-v2.html`
- **Status**: Active functional area with proper organization

## Design Refresh Integration
The new **Design Refresh** functional area at `/docs/functional-areas/design-refresh/` will work with the proper homepage functional area to modernize the design while maintaining the correct organizational structure.

## Related Archives
- **Vertical Slice Project**: `/docs/_archive/vertical-slice-home-page-2025-08-16/` - Main project archive with all extracted patterns
- **Authentication Blazor Legacy**: `/docs/_archive/authentication-blazor-legacy-2025-08-19/` - Related legacy technology archival

## Quality Assurance
✅ **Confirmed**: No unique or valuable information was lost in this archival
✅ **Verified**: Proper homepage functional area exists and is actively maintained
✅ **Validated**: All lint validation processes preserved in standards documentation

## Next Steps for Homepage Development
1. **Use Correct Location**: All homepage work at `/docs/functional-areas/homepage/`
2. **Design Refresh**: New aesthetic work at `/docs/functional-areas/design-refresh/`
3. **Quality Standards**: Reference preserved lint validation processes in standards documentation
4. **No Duplication**: This archive prevents future confusion from duplicate folders
