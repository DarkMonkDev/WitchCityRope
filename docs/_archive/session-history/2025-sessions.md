**üìã Remaining Items**: Minor polish for optimal development experience (see CURRENT_ISSUES_AND_SOLUTIONS.md)

### Future Authentication Enhancements (July 16, 2025)

**Authentication Migration Analysis Completed**: After comprehensive analysis, migration to .NET 9 Blazor interactive authentication is **NOT RECOMMENDED** for this pure Blazor Server application. See `/docs/enhancements/authentication-enhancements/README.md` for detailed analysis and high-value, low-effort enhancement opportunities including:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Infrastructure exists but disabled (2-3 days to enable)
- **Custom Claims System**: Infrastructure exists but disabled (1-2 days to enable)  
- **Social Login Enhancements**: Build on existing Google OAuth foundation
- **Advanced Security Features**: Audit logging, password breach detection, session management

**Key Finding**: Current ASP.NET Core Identity implementation is production-ready and well-architected for Blazor Server. Focus on feature enhancements rather than architectural migration.

### Critical Lessons Learned: Authentication & Container Issues (July 16, 2025)

**This section documents critical discoveries from authentication modernization that future developers MUST know to avoid repeating the same mistakes.**

#### 1. DOCKER HOT RELOAD IS UNRELIABLE - ALWAYS RESTART CONTAINERS
**PROBLEM**: Made authentication fixes but user reported "nothing has changed" - changes weren't being picked up by Docker hot reload.
**SOLUTION**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart web`
**LESSON**: When user reports changes aren't working, FIRST restart containers before assuming code issues.
**WHY**: .NET 9 Blazor Server hot reload in Docker containers is notoriously unreliable, especially for authentication/layout changes.

#### 2. .NET 9 RENDER MODE SYNTAX CHANGE
**PROBLEM**: Used old `@rendermode InteractiveServer` syntax causing compilation errors.
**CORRECT SYNTAX**: `@rendermode @(new Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web.InteractiveServerRenderMode())`
**CRITICAL**: Layout components (MainLayout) CANNOT have interactive render modes - they receive RenderFragment parameters that cannot be serialized.
**SOLUTION**: Move interactive behavior to separate components, embed in layout.

#### 3. AUTHENTICATION STATE INCONSISTENCY PATTERNS
**PROBLEM**: "My Dashboard" showing for unauthenticated users while login button also showing.
**ROOT CAUSE**: Duplicate authentication logic in MainLayout AND UserMenuComponent competing with each other.
**SYMPTOMS**:
- Different UI elements showing conflicting authentication states
- Race conditions between custom auth service and built-in AuthorizeView
- Stale authentication state after login/logout

**SOLUTION PATTERN**:
```csharp
// ‚ùå BAD: Multiple auth state sources
private UserDto? _currentUser; // in MainLayout
@if (_currentUser != null) { ... }
// AND separate UserMenuComponent with its own auth logic

// ‚úÖ GOOD: Single source of truth
<AuthorizeView>
  <Authorized>My Dashboard</Authorized>
</AuthorizeView>
// Use AuthorizeView consistently everywhere
```

#### 4. AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM IDENTIFICATION
**DISCOVERY**: This project uses **ASP.NET Core Identity** (traditional), NOT the latest Blazor Server interactive authentication.
**EVIDENCE**:
- `AddIdentityCore<WitchCityRopeUser>()` + `AddIdentityCookies()`
- Cookie-based authentication with `IdentityConstants.ApplicationScheme`
- Custom `IAuthService` and `SimplifiedIdentityAuthService`
- Manual state management vs. built-in Blazor auth components

**IMPLICATION**: Don't try to modernize to Blazor Server interactive auth patterns - this project correctly uses ASP.NET Core Identity.

#### 5. COMPILATION ERROR DEBUGGING PATTERN
**PROBLEM**: Application compiled with warnings but failed at runtime with serialization errors.
**DEBUGGING STEPS**:
1. Check container logs for "Waiting for a file to change" (means compilation succeeded)
2. Test with `curl -s -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:5651 -o /dev/null`
3. If 500 error, check actual error: `curl -s http://localhost:5651 2>&1 | head -10`
4. If container restart needed: `docker-compose restart web`
5. If still fails: `docker exec witchcity-web dotnet build --verbosity minimal`

#### 6. AUTHENTICATION MODERNIZATION CHECKLIST
When fixing auth state inconsistencies:
- [ ] Remove duplicate auth logic from layouts
- [ ] Standardize on `AuthorizeView` components
- [ ] Fix .NET 9 render mode syntax
- [ ] Move interactive behavior out of layout components
- [ ] Restart containers to ensure changes are picked up
- [ ] Test authentication state consistency across all UI elements
- [ ] Verify mobile menu authentication state matches desktop

#### 7. CONTAINER RESTART TRIGGERS
Always restart containers after:
- Authentication/authorization changes
- Layout component modifications  
- Render mode changes
- Dependency injection modifications
- Route configuration changes

**COMMAND**: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml restart web`

## January 2025 Sessions

### Recent Fixes (January 22, 2025) - Session 2

#### Authentication State Propagation Fixed
- **Issue**: After implementing Razor Pages for authentication, Blazor components weren't updating with auth state
- **Solution**: Properly registered `AuthenticationStateProvider` in Program.cs
- **Key Changes**:
  - MainLayout now uses `AuthorizeView` components instead of custom auth service
  - Removed duplicate authentication state management
  - Authentication state now properly flows from Razor Pages login to Blazor components

#### Event Seeding Fixed
- **Issue**: Events page showed "No events found" despite seeding code existing
- **Root Cause**: Event seeding was commented out in DbInitializer
- **Solution**:
  - Updated Event constructor calls to match current signature
  - Fixed Currency.USD ‚Üí "USD" string format
  - Fixed user email references (teacher@ ‚Üí organizer@)
  - Events now properly display on the events page

#### User Dropdown Menu Fixed
- **Issue**: User menu dropdown wouldn't open when clicked
- **Root Cause**: Blazor event handlers weren't binding due to AuthorizeView re-rendering
- **Solution**: Replaced complex JavaScript/Blazor event handling with native HTML `<details>/<summary>` elements
- **Benefits**:
  - No dependency on JavaScript initialization
  - Works reliably with pure HTML/CSS
  - Properly shows user info and menu options
  - Click-outside behavior to close dropdown

### Recent Fixes (January 22, 2025) - Session 1

#### Authorization Migration Fix - Blazor Server Authentication Pattern (January 22, 2025)
- **Critical Issue**: "Headers are read-only, response has already started" error when using SignInManager in Blazor components
- **Root Cause**: SignInManager cannot be used directly in Blazor Server interactive components
- **Microsoft's Solution**: Use API endpoints for all authentication operations
- **What Was Done**:
  - Created `AuthEndpoints.cs` with `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/register` endpoints
  - Modified `IdentityAuthService.cs` to call API endpoints instead of SignInManager
  - Fixed HttpClient to use internal container port (8080) instead of external (5651)
  - Authentication now follows pattern: Blazor ‚Üí API ‚Üí SignInManager ‚Üí Cookies
- **Key Learning**: This is the ONLY way authentication works in pure Blazor Server applications
- **Documentation**: See `/docs/AUTHORIZATION_MIGRATION.md` for complete details

### Previous Fixes (January 15, 2025)

#### Integration Test Infrastructure Migration to PostgreSQL (January 15, 2025) - COMPLETED
- **Task**: Fix database provider conflicts and migrate to real PostgreSQL for integration testing
- **Initial Problem**: "Services for database providers 'Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL', 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory' have been registered"
- **What Was Done**:
  - Migrated from in-memory database to PostgreSQL using Testcontainers
  - Fixed all database-related bugs that were hidden by in-memory provider
  - Updated all test classes to use shared PostgreSQL fixture pattern
  - Fixed all DateTime UTC issues for PostgreSQL compatibility
  - Fixed all duplicate test data issues (SceneName, Email)
- **Critical Bugs Discovered and Fixed**:
  1. **RefundAmount nullable owned entity bug** - EF Core can't configure nullable owned entities
     - Solution: Restructured to use separate nullable properties (RefundAmountValue, RefundCurrency)
  2. **RSVP duplicate key violations** - Missing Id initialization in constructor
     - Solution: Added `Id = Guid.NewGuid()` to RSVP constructor
  3. **DateTime UTC requirements** - PostgreSQL timestamp with time zone only accepts UTC
     - Solution: Added automatic UTC conversion in DbContext.UpdateAuditFields()
  4. **Duplicate test data** - Tests failing due to unique constraint violations
     - Solution: All test data now uses GUIDs for uniqueness
- **Test Results**:
  - Before: 93 tests couldn't run due to architectural issues
  - After migration: 37 failures (database issues exposed)
  - Final: 115 passing, 18 failing (UI/navigation tests only)
- **Key Files Updated**:
  - `/tests/WitchCityRope.IntegrationTests/TestWebApplicationFactory.cs` - PostgreSQL container setup

  - `/tests/e2e/test-member-rsvp-api.js` - API-based test
  - `/tests/e2e/diagnose-event-form.js` - Form diagnostic tool
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Blazor forms need proper error display for debugging
  - Silent failures make testing difficult
  - API-based tests can bypass UI issues for validation

#### Test Compilation Fixes (January 11, 2025 - Session 3)
- **Task**: Fix remaining test compilation errors after Registration ‚Üí Ticket refactoring
- **What Was Done**:
  - Renamed RegistrationTests.cs to TicketTests.cs and updated all references
  - Fixed Ticket constructor calls to include emergency contact parameters
  - Updated test expectations (eventToAttend ‚Üí eventToRegister)
  - Fixed EventTests.cs and UserTests.cs navigation property references
  - Updated E2E test selectors and Puppeteer compatibility issues
- **Key Files**:
  - `/tests/WitchCityRope.Core.Tests/Entities/TicketTests.cs` - Complete refactoring
  - `/tests/e2e/test-rsvp-functionality.js` - Selector and compatibility fixes
- **Result**: All Core tests passing (202/203), E2E tests updated
- **Key Learnings**:
  - Always check parameter names in constructor error messages
  - Puppeteer doesn't support :has-text() pseudo-selector
  - waitForTimeout was deprecated, use setTimeout instead
  - Keyboard shortcuts need proper key sequences (down/press/up)

#### Registration to Ticket Refactoring Fixes (January 11, 2025 - Session 2)
- **Task**: Fix all compilation errors after Registration ‚Üí Ticket + RSVP refactoring
- **What Was Done**:
  - Fixed duplicate DTO definitions (EventTicketRequest, RsvpDto already in CommonDtos.cs)
  - Created missing RsvpStatus enum (Confirmed, Waitlisted, CheckedIn, Cancelled)
  - Updated all RegistrationStatus references to TicketStatus throughout codebase
  - Fixed property name changes (RegisteredAt ‚Üí PurchasedAt)
  - Updated DbContext, AutoMapper profiles, and services to use Tickets
  - Resolved navigation property issues (WitchCityRopeUser has no Tickets collection)
  - Created comprehensive E2E Puppeteer tests for RSVP and Ticket functionality
- **Key Files**:
  - `/src/WitchCityRope.Core/Enums/RsvpStatus.cs` - Created new enum

  - `/tests/e2e/test-rsvp-functionality.js` - RSVP flow testing
  - `/tests/e2e/test-ticket-functionality.js` - Ticket flow testing
- **Key Learnings**: 
  - Always search for ALL references when refactoring entities (navigation properties, DbSets, mappers, services)
  - Duplicate DTO definitions cause confusing compilation errors
  - EF Core requires navigation properties to exist on entities for LINQ queries

#### Admin Events Management Full Implementation (January 11, 2025 - Session 1)
- **Task**: Complete implementation of Admin Events Management with all 4 tabs connected to backend
- **What Was Done**:
  - Fixed API compilation errors (VolunteerController, EventEmailController, EventService)
  - Connected EventEdit component to real APIs (LoadEvent, SaveEvent, LoadAvailableUsers)
  - Implemented volunteer task CRUD operations with API integration
  - Connected email template operations (load, save, send test, send custom)
  - Added real orders/attendees data loading
  - Created comprehensive Puppeteer test suite
- **Key Files**:
  - `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Features/Admin/Pages/EventEdit.razor` - Full API integration
  - `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Services/ApiClient.cs` - Added GetUsersAsync, CreateEventAsync, UpdateEventAsync, GetEventAttendeesAsync
  - `/src/WitchCityRope.Core/DTOs/CommonDtos.cs` - Added CreateEventRequest DTO
  - `/tests/e2e/admin-events-management.test.js` - Comprehensive test suite
  - `/tests/e2e/run-admin-events-tests.js` - Simplified test runner
- **Result**: All 4 tabs (Basic Info, Tickets/Orders, Emails, Volunteers/Staff) now fully functional with real data

#### EmailAddress Entity Discovery Issue Fixed (January 10, 2025)
- **Issue**: EF Core migration generation failed with "The entity type 'EmailAddress' requires a primary key to be defined"
- **Root Cause**: The recent migration from custom authentication to ASP.NET Core Identity left navigation properties to the old Core.User entity in VolunteerAssignment, causing EF Core to discover the ignored User entity and its EmailAddress value object
- **Fixes**:
  - Removed User navigation property from VolunteerAssignment entity
  - Updated VolunteerAssignmentConfiguration to remove User relationship mapping
  - Fixed VolunteerService to remove references to User navigation property in Include statements
  - Added explicit exclusion of Core.User entity in WitchCityRopeIdentityDbContext
- **Files**: 
  - `/src/WitchCityRope.Core/Entities/VolunteerAssignment.cs`
  - `/src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure/Data/Configurations/VolunteerAssignmentConfiguration.cs`
  - `/src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure/Services/VolunteerService.cs`
  - `/src/WitchCityRope.Infrastructure/Data/WitchCityRopeIdentityDbContext.cs`
- **Key Learning**: When migrating authentication systems, ensure all navigation properties to the old user entity are removed to prevent EF Core entity discovery issues

#### Authentication Fixed (January 7, 2025)
- **Issue**: Login failed with "Invalid login attempt"
- **Fix**: Updated Login.cshtml.cs to use `PasswordSignInByEmailOrSceneNameAsync` instead of standard `PasswordSignInAsync`
- **File**: `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Areas/Identity/Pages/Account/Login.cshtml.cs`

#### Event Edit Fixed (January 7, 2025)
- **Issue**: Compilation errors and form not working
- **Fixes**: 
  - Route parameter: `{EventId:int}` ‚Üí `{EventId:guid}`
  - Property mappings: Title‚ÜíName, StartDate‚ÜíStartDateTime, etc.
  - Form selector: `input[name="Title"]` ‚Üí `input[name="model.Title"]`
- **Files**: `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Features/Admin/Pages/EventEdit.razor`, `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Services/ApiClient.cs`

#### Docker Hot Reload Fixed (January 7, 2025)
- **Issue**: Changes not reflected without full container restart
- **Fix**: Created dev tools: `./dev.sh`, `./restart-web.sh`, `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- **Usage**: Use `./restart-web.sh` for quick restart, `./dev.sh` option 7 for rebuild
