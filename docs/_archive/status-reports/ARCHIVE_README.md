# Status Reports Archive
<!-- Archived: 2025-08-04 -->
<!-- Archived By: Documentation Reorganization Project -->

## Overview
This directory contains archived status and progress reports that have been consolidated into the single authoritative PROGRESS.md file in the project root.

## Archived Files

### Progress Reports
- `PROGRESS_OLD.md` - Original root-level progress file
- `PROGRESS_DOCS.md` - Progress file from docs folder
- `PROJECT_STATUS_2024_12_30.md` - December 2024 detailed status report
- `CURRENT_PROJECT_STATUS.md` - January 2025 status with test fixes
- `MIGRATION_STATUS_REPORT.md` - Database migration status tracking
- `FORM_MIGRATION_STATUS.md` - Form component migration tracking

## Consolidation Summary

All information from these status reports has been consolidated into:
- `/PROGRESS.md` - The single authoritative progress document

## What Was Consolidated

1. **Build and Test Status**: Current state of all test suites
2. **Architecture Decisions**: Web+API pattern, technology choices
3. **Feature Implementation Status**: Completed, in-progress, and planned features
4. **Technical Debt**: Known issues and priorities
5. **Development Guidelines**: Critical rules and patterns
6. **Recent Session History**: Key fixes and migrations
7. **Performance Metrics**: Application and development velocity

## Why Consolidated

These documents were archived because:
1. Multiple overlapping status reports created confusion
2. Different reports had conflicting information
3. No clear "single source of truth" for project status
4. Information was scattered across multiple files
5. Difficult to maintain consistency across reports

## Key Improvements

The consolidated PROGRESS.md provides:
- Single authoritative source for project status
- Clear structure with consistent sections
- Up-to-date information in one location
- Better discoverability for new developers
- Easier maintenance and updates

## Using the Consolidated Document

For current project status, always refer to `/PROGRESS.md` in the project root.

Do NOT update these archived files - they are retained for historical reference only.
