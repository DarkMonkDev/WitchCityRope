# Witch City Rope Copy Examples

## Applying Brand Voice to Interface Copy

### Authentication Pages

#### Login Form
**Current Copy:**
- Title: "Welcome back"
- Subtitle: "Login to access member events and manage your tickets"

**Updated with Brand Voice:**
- Title: "Welcome back to the community!"
- Subtitle: "Ready to continue your rope journey? Sign in to explore events and connect."

**Why this works:**
- "community" reinforces belonging
- "rope journey" connects to our tagline
- "explore" and "connect" are more playful than "access" and "manage"

#### Registration Form
**Current Copy:**
- Title: "Join Witch City Rope" 
- Subtitle: "Create an account to apply for membership"

**Updated with Brand Voice:**

**Why this works:**
- Emphasizes journey and growth (core values)
- "with us" and "together" reinforce partnership
- More inviting than transactional "apply for membership"
