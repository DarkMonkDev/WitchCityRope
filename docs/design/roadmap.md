- Generate test cases for what you'll build

**Coding Sessions:**
Use Claude for:
- Writing service methods
- Creating Blazor components
- Solving specific technical problems
- Refactoring suggestions

**End of Day:**
- Have Claude review your code for improvements
- Generate documentation for completed features
- Create tomorrow's task list

### Efficient Claude Prompts

```
"Create a service class for [feature] following vertical slice architecture with these methods: [list]. Include error handling and logging."
```

**For UI Components:**
```
"Create a Blazor component using Syncfusion for [feature]. Include loading states, error handling, and mobile responsiveness."
```

**For Business Logic:**
```

```

## Technical Decisions for Solo Development

### Recommended Stack (Updated)
- **Framework:** ASP.NET 9 with Blazor Server
- **Database:** SQLite (simpler than PostgreSQL for MVP)
- **UI Library:** Syncfusion Blazor components
- **Payments:** PayPal Checkout SDK
- **Logging:** Built-in ILogger (simpler than Serilog for MVP)
- **Caching:** IMemoryCache for session data and frequently accessed items
- **Validation:** Data Annotations + custom validators
- **Architecture:** Simplified vertical slice with direct service injection
- **Email:** SendGrid for transactional emails and notifications

### Security Essentials
**Claude Can Generate:**
- OWASP security checklist adapted for your app
- Input validation rules
- XSS prevention code
- SQL injection prevention patterns
- Secure payment handling guidelines

## Time-Saving Tips

1. **Template Everything:** Have Claude create templates for common patterns (features, components, tests)

2. **Batch Similar Tasks:** Do all CRUD operations at once, all forms at once, etc.

3. **Use Claude for Boilerplate:**
   - Entity configurations
   - Validation rules
   - Email templates
   - Test fixtures

4. **Progressive Enhancement:** Launch with basic features and add complexity based on user feedback

5. **Documentation as You Go:** Have Claude generate documentation from your code comments

## Success Metrics (Simplified)

- **MVP Launch:** 8-10 weeks from start
- **Core Features Working:** Auth, Vetting, Events, Payments, Check-in
- **Initial User Feedback:** Positive from 20+ beta users
- **Technical Debt:** Keep under 20% of codebase
- **Performance:** Page loads under 2 seconds

## Next Steps

- âœ… **Completed:** Create GitHub repo and initial project structure
- âœ… **Completed:** Reorganize design documents and create comprehensive user flows
- **Current Week:** Complete remaining wireframes (authentication, member pages, admin screens)
- **Next Week:** Finalize all design documents and copy
- **Following Week:** Set up development environment with Syncfusion and begin Sprint 1

## Claude Prompt Library for This Project

Save these prompts for repeated use:

1. "Generate a complete Blazor component for [feature] with Syncfusion, including form validation and error handling"

2. "Create an Entity Framework entity for [model] with appropriate relationships, indexes, and configurations for SQLite"

3. "Write a service class for [feature] with methods, validation, and tests"

4. "Generate unit tests for [class] covering all public methods and edge cases"

5. "Create a database migration script for [feature] with rollback capability"

6. "Review this code for SOLID principles and suggest improvements: [code]"

7. "Generate API documentation for this endpoint: [endpoint details]"

8. "Create a mobile-responsive check-in interface using Syncfusion Blazor"

## Architecture Changes from Original Plan

1. **Database:** SQLite for MVP (simpler than PostgreSQL, no hosting costs, can migrate later if needed)
2. **Architecture:** Vertical slice instead of layered (better feature cohesion)
3. **Deployment:** Single container on low-cost VPS instead of complex cloud setup
4. **Patterns:** Direct DbContext usage instead of repository pattern (simpler for small app)

## Risk Mitigation

- **PayPal Integration:** Start with sandbox early in Sprint 3
- **Performance:** SQLite is fine for 600 users, monitor concurrent writes
- **Caching:** Use IMemoryCache to reduce database queries for frequently accessed data
- **Security:** 2FA mandatory, encrypted PII, regular backups
- **Scalability:** Can migrate to PostgreSQL later if needed
