# CI/CD Setup Summary

This document summarizes the comprehensive CI/CD integration that has been set up for the WitchCityRope project.

## Overview

The project now has a robust CI/CD pipeline implementation across multiple platforms with the following components:

### 1. GitHub Actions (Primary CI/CD)
**File:** `.github/workflows/test.yml`

**Features:**
- ✅ Automated testing on push/PR to main/develop branches
- ✅ .NET 9.0 SDK setup with caching
- ✅ Parallel execution of unit and integration tests
- ✅ Code coverage reporting with Codecov integration
- ✅ Test result reporting with annotations
- ✅ Code quality checks (formatting, static analysis)
- ✅ Coverage thresholds enforcement (60% minimum)
- ✅ SQL Server service container for integration tests
- ✅ Artifact uploads for test results and coverage reports
- ✅ PR comments with coverage details

### 2. Security Scanning Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/security.yml`

**Features:**
- ✅ Scheduled weekly vulnerability scans
- ✅ On-demand scanning via workflow dispatch
- ✅ NuGet package vulnerability detection
- ✅ OWASP Dependency Check integration
- ✅ Automatic issue creation for vulnerabilities
- ✅ Security report artifacts

### 3. Azure DevOps Pipeline
**File:** `azure-pipelines.yml`

**Features:**
- ✅ Multi-stage pipeline architecture
- ✅ Service container support for SQL Server
- ✅ Cached dependencies for faster builds
- ✅ Separate stages for build, integration tests, and code quality
- ✅ Conditional packaging stage for main branch
- ✅ Built-in Azure DevOps test/coverage reporting
- ✅ Artifact publishing for deployment

### 4. GitLab CI Pipeline
**File:** `.gitlab-ci.yml`

**Features:**
- ✅ Docker-based execution environment
- ✅ Parallel job execution for faster feedback
- ✅ GitLab Pages integration for coverage reports
- ✅ Container registry support with automatic tagging
- ✅ Security scanning for vulnerable packages
- ✅ Database migration validation
- ✅ Comprehensive caching strategy

### 5. Pre-commit Hooks
**File:** `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**Local Checks:**
- ✅ Code formatting with `dotnet format`
- ✅ Build validation before commit
- ✅ Unit test execution
- ✅ Coverage verification (on push)
- ✅ File format validation (JSON, YAML, XML)
- ✅ Trailing whitespace cleanup
- ✅ Security scanning for hardcoded secrets
- ✅ NuGet vulnerability detection
- ✅ EF Core migration validation

### 6. Test Scripts
**Files:** 
- `run-tests-coverage.sh` (Linux/macOS)
- `run-tests-coverage.cmd` (Windows)

**Features:**
- ✅ One-command test execution with coverage
- ✅ HTML coverage report generation
- ✅ Coverage threshold checking
- ✅ Automatic browser opening for reports
- ✅ Color-coded output for better readability

## Build Status Badges

The README.md has been updated with build status badges for all CI/CD platforms:
- GitHub Actions status badge
- Azure DevOps build status
- GitLab pipeline status
- Codecov coverage badge
- GitLab coverage badge
- Pre-commit enabled badge

## Documentation

**Created/Updated:**
1. **README.md** - Added comprehensive CI/CD section with badges
2. **docs/CI_CD_GUIDE.md** - Detailed setup and maintenance guide
3. **CI_CD_SETUP_SUMMARY.md** - This summary document

## Key Benefits

1. **Multi-Platform Support**: Works with GitHub, Azure DevOps, and GitLab
2. **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, and code quality checks
3. **Fast Feedback**: Caching and parallel execution for quick builds
4. **Security First**: Automated vulnerability scanning and secret detection
5. **Developer Experience**: Pre-commit hooks catch issues early
6. **Visibility**: Clear reporting and status badges
7. **Automation**: Minimal manual intervention required

## Coverage Requirements

All pipelines enforce these minimum thresholds:
- Line Coverage: 60%
- Branch Coverage: 60%
- Method Coverage: 60%

## Next Steps

To use these CI/CD pipelines:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Already active - no setup needed
2. **Azure DevOps**: Import repo and create pipeline from `azure-pipelines.yml`
3. **GitLab CI**: Import repo - pipeline runs automatically
4. **Pre-commit**: Run `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`

## Required Secrets/Variables

### GitHub Actions
- `CODECOV_TOKEN` (optional but recommended)

### Azure DevOps
- No additional configuration required

### GitLab CI
- `CI_REGISTRY_USER` (for Docker push)
- `CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD` (for Docker push)

## Maintenance

Regular maintenance tasks are documented in `docs/CI_CD_GUIDE.md` including:
- Weekly security reviews
- Monthly performance optimization
- Quarterly secret rotation

The CI/CD setup is now complete and ready for use!
