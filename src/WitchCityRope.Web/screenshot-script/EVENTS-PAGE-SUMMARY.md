# Events Page Analysis Summary

## Quick Status Report

### ✅ Search Icon/Functionality
- **Status:** PRESENT AND WORKING
- **Location:** Filter bar, line 38 in EventList.razor
- **Code:** `<span class="search-icon e-icons e-search"></span>`
- **Search Input:** Fully functional with real-time filtering

### ❌ Event Cards Display
- **Status:** NOT DISPLAYING
- **Root Cause:** Default filter hides past events
- **Code Location:** Lines 208-210 in EventList.razor
```csharp
filtered = showPastEvents 
    ? filtered.Where(e => e.IsPast)
    : filtered.Where(e => !e.IsPast);
```

### ✅ Page Layout
- **Status:** NO ISSUES DETECTED
- **Structure:** Properly organized with hero section, filter bar, and content area

## The Problem

The events page is working correctly but showing an empty state because:

1. **Mock events are likely dated in the past** (common for test data)
2. **Default filter shows only upcoming events** (`showPastEvents = false`)
3. **Line 182 marks events as past:** `IsPast = e.StartDate < DateTime.Now`

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Click "Show Past Classes" Button
The button is already there! Users just need to click it to see past events.

### Option 2: Update Mock Data
Ensure mock events have future dates when generated.

### Option 3: Change Default Filter
Set `showPastEvents = true` by default during development.

## Visual Elements Found

1. **Search Box:** ✅ Present with icon and input field
2. **Filter Controls:** ✅ "Show Past Classes" button and sort dropdown
3. **Hero Section:** ✅ Title and subtitle displaying correctly
4. **Empty State:** ✅ Shows when no events match current filters

## File Locations

- **Main Component:** `/Features/Events/Pages/EventList.razor`
- **Event Loading:** Line 166 - `EventService.GetUpcomingEventsAsync()`
- **Filter Logic:** Lines 197-229 - `ApplyFilters()` method
- **Search Implementation:** Lines 237-247

## Recommendation

The page is working as designed. To see mock events:
1. Click the "Show Past Classes" button, OR
2. Update mock data to use future dates, OR
3. Temporarily change line 208 to show all events by default
