# Browser MCP Working Solution for WSL

## Current Status
✅ Chrome is running with DevTools on port 9222
✅ Chrome is accessible from Windows PowerShell
⚠️ Chrome is NOT directly accessible from WSL (localhost only)

## Working Solutions

### Option 1: SSH Tunnel (Recommended)
```bash
# In WSL terminal 1:
ssh -L 9222:localhost:9222 $(whoami.exe | tr -d '\r\n' | cut -d'\' -f2)@172.25.0.1

# In WSL terminal 2:
export LOCAL_CDP_URL="http://localhost:9222"
# Now Browser Tools and Stagehand can connect
```

### Option 2: PowerShell Bridge
Use the browser-mcp-bridge.sh script which executes commands via PowerShell.

### Option 3: Restart Chrome (Less Secure)
```cmd
# Close Chrome and restart with:
chrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --remote-debugging-address=0.0.0.0 --incognito
```

## What Each MCP Server Can Do

### Browser Tools MCP
- Take screenshots
- Monitor console logs
- Extract page content
- Run accessibility audits
- Analyze performance

### Stagehand MCP
- Natural language browser control
- Click elements by description
- Fill forms intelligently
- Extract structured data
- Multi-step automation

Both are configured and ready to use once Chrome is accessible from WSL.
