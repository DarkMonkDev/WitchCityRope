# Memory MCP Server Test Results

## Test Summary

The Memory MCP server has been successfully tested and verified to be working correctly with full persistence support.

## Test Details

### 1. Installation
- Successfully installed `@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory` version 2025.4.25
- The package provides a knowledge graph-based persistent memory system

### 2. Server Capabilities
The Memory MCP server provides the following tools:

#### Entity Management
- `create_entities` - Create multiple new entities in the knowledge graph
- `delete_entities` - Delete entities and their associated relations
- `add_observations` - Add new observations to existing entities
- `delete_observations` - Delete specific observations from entities

#### Relationship Management
- `create_relations` - Create relationships between entities
- `delete_relations` - Delete relationships from the graph

#### Query Operations
- `read_graph` - Read the entire knowledge graph
- `search_nodes` - Search for nodes based on a query
- `open_nodes` - Open specific nodes by their names

### 3. Test Scenarios Completed

1. **Project Information Storage**
   - Created a "WitchCityRope Project" entity with 6 observations about the project
   - Entity type: "project"
   - Successfully stored comprehensive project metadata

2. **Component Storage**
   - Created 3 component entities:
     - API Backend (4 observations)
     - Blazor Frontend (4 observations)
     - Infrastructure Layer (4 observations)
   - All components stored with type "component"

3. **Relationship Creation**
   - Established 5 relationships:
     - Project "contains" API Backend
     - Project "contains" Blazor Frontend
     - Project "contains" Infrastructure Layer
     - Blazor Frontend "depends_on" API Backend
     - API Backend "depends_on" Infrastructure Layer

4. **Data Retrieval**
   - Successfully searched for entities using query "project"
   - Retrieved the entire knowledge graph
   - Opened specific nodes by name

5. **Data Updates**
   - Added 3 new observations to the WitchCityRope Project entity
   - Verified that new observations were persisted correctly

## Persistence Verification

The test confirmed that all data operations are persistent:
- Entities remain stored after creation
- Relationships are maintained between entities
- New observations are appended to existing entities
- All data can be retrieved through various query methods

## File Locations

- Test Script: `/mnt/c/users/chad/source/repos/WitchCityRope/src/mcp-servers/test-memory-persistence.js`
- Discovery Script: `/mnt/c/users/chad/source/repos/WitchCityRope/src/mcp-servers/discover-memory-tools.js`
- Package Configuration: `/mnt/c/users/chad/source/repos/WitchCityRope/src/mcp-servers/package.json`

## Usage Example

To use the Memory MCP server in your configuration:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

The Memory MCP server is fully functional and provides a robust knowledge graph system for storing and retrieving structured information about projects, with support for entities, observations, and relationships. The persistence mechanism ensures that all stored data is maintained across sessions.
