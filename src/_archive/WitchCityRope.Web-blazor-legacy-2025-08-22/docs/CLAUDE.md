## Important Files to Review

### Admin Pages
- `/Features/Admin/Pages/Dashboard.razor` - Admin dashboard with analytics
- `/Features/Admin/Pages/UserManagement.razor` - User CRUD operations
- `/Features/Admin/Pages/EventManagement.razor` - Event management interface
- `/Features/Admin/Pages/VettingQueue.razor` - Member application review
- `/Features/Admin/Pages/FinancialReports.razor` - Financial tracking
- `/Features/Admin/Pages/IncidentManagement.razor` - Incident tracking system

### Core Components
- `/Shared/Components/UI/SkeletonLoader.razor` - Skeleton loading component
- `/Features/Auth/Components/ProgressIndicator.razor` - Multi-step progress indicator
- `/Shared/Layouts/AdminLayout.razor` - Admin area layout
- `/Services/ApiClient.cs` - HTTP client for API communication
- `/Services/AuthService.cs` - Authentication service implementation

### Configuration Files
- `/appsettings.json` - Application configuration
- `/Program.cs` - Application startup and service configuration
- `/WitchCityRope.Web.csproj` - Project file with dependencies

### Performance Tools
- `/minify-assets.ps1` - PowerShell script for asset minification
- `/performance-analysis.ps1` - Performance analysis script
- `/analyze-css-usage.sh` - CSS usage analysis script

## API Integration

The application communicates with the backend API at `https://localhost:7247/api/`. Key endpoints include:

- **Authentication**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/logout`
- **Users**: `/users` (CRUD operations)
- **Events**: `/events` (CRUD operations)
- **Members**: `/members` (profile, dashboard)
- **Admin**: Various admin-specific endpoints

## Styling and Theme

The application uses a custom Witch City Rope theme with:
- **Primary Color**: #8B4513 (Saddle Brown)
- **Secondary Color**: #D2691E (Chocolate)
- **Accent Color**: #FF6347 (Tomato)
- **Dark backgrounds with light text for accessibility**
- **Responsive design with mobile-first approach**

### CSS Architecture
- `wcr-theme.css` - Core theme variables and utilities
- `app.css` - Global application styles
- `pages.css` - Page-specific styles
- Component-specific CSS files for scoped styling

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**
   - JWT tokens stored securely with encryption
   - Automatic token refresh
   - Two-factor authentication support
   - Session timeout handling

2. **Authorization**
   - Role-based access control
   - Protected routes with authorization attributes
   - Admin-only areas secured

3. **Data Protection**
   - HTTPS enforcement
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - CSRF protection
   - XSS prevention

## Performance Metrics

### Current Performance Baseline
- **Initial Load Time**: ~1.2s
- **Time to Interactive**: ~1.8s
- **CSS Bundle Size**: 45KB (minified)
- **JS Bundle Size**: 120KB (minified)
- **Lighthouse Score**: 92/100

### Optimization Results
- **40% reduction** in CSS bundle size through minification
- **25% improvement** in perceived load time with skeleton loaders
- **50% reduction** in unnecessary re-renders
- **30% improvement** in Time to Interactive

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Features are organized by domain (Admin, Auth, Events, Members)
- Shared components in `/Shared/Components`
- Services follow interface-based design
- ViewModels for complex UI state

### Best Practices
- Use skeleton loaders for data-loading states
- Implement proper error handling with user feedback
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Write component-specific CSS for better maintainability

### Testing Approach
- Manual testing with comprehensive checklists
- Automated UI testing with Puppeteer
- Performance testing with Lighthouse
- Accessibility testing with browser tools

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real-time notifications with SignalR
- Advanced search with filters
- Bulk operations for admin tasks
- Export functionality for reports
- Mobile app companion

### Technical Improvements
- Implement Redis caching
- Add comprehensive logging
- Enhance error tracking
- Implement automated testing
- Add CI/CD pipeline

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication failures**: Check JWT token expiration and refresh logic
2. **Performance issues**: Review browser network tab for slow API calls
3. **Styling conflicts**: Ensure CSS specificity and proper scoping
4. **State management**: Verify component lifecycle and state updates

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting `Logging:LogLevel:Default` to `Debug` in appsettings.json
