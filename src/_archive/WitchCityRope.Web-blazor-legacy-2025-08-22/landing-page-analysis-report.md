**Generated:** 2025-06-28
**URL:** http://localhost:5651

## Summary

Based on the HTML content analysis of the landing page, here's a comprehensive report on compliance with the wireframe requirements:

## Wireframe Compliance Check

### 1. Hero Section
- **Found:** ✅
- **Tagline:** "Building community through the art of rope bondage in Salem, Massachusetts"
- **Correct Tagline ("Where curiosity meets connection"):** ❌
- **Multi-line Title with Education & Practice emphasis:** ❌
- **Title found:** "Welcome to Witch City Rope"

**DISCREPANCY:** The hero section exists but has a different tagline than specified in the wireframe. The current tagline focuses on "Building community" rather than "Where curiosity meets connection". There's no multi-line title with emphasis on "Education & Practice".

### 2. Navigation
- **Found:** ✅
- **Login Link:** ❌ (Not visible in main navigation for non-authenticated users)
- **Sign Up Link:** ✅ (Found as "Join Our Community" and "Get Started" buttons)

**DISCREPANCY:** The navigation doesn't show explicit Login/Sign Up links in the header for non-authenticated users. Instead, there are CTA buttons in the hero and other sections.

### 3. Rope SVG Divider
- **Found:** ❌
- **Evidence:** No SVG elements found in the HTML that represent rope dividers between sections

**DISCREPANCY:** No rope SVG divider elements were found between sections as specified in the wireframe.

### 4. Features Section
- **Found:** ✅
- **Section Title:** "What We Offer" 
- **Correct Title ("What Makes Our Community Special"):** ❌
- **Feature Cards:** 4 (Educational Workshops, Performances, Community Events, Safety First)

**DISCREPANCY:** The features section exists but with a different title. It says "What We Offer" instead of "What Makes Our Community Special".

### 5. Footer
- **Found:** ✅
- **Section Count:** 3 (Main section, Quick Links, Support)
- **Correct Section Count:** ❌ (Expected: 4, Found: 3)

**DISCREPANCY:** Footer has 3 sections instead of the required 4 sections.

### 6. Color Scheme
- **Has Gradients:** ✅ (Hero section uses gradient: "linear-gradient(135deg, var(--color-burgundy) 0%, var(--color-plum) 100%)")
- **CSS Variables Found:**
  - --wcr-color-burgundy: #880124 ✅
  - --wcr-color-amber: #FFBF00 ✅
  - --wcr-color-plum: #614B79 ✅
  - --wcr-color-electric: #9D4EDD (purple) ✅

**COMPLIANT:** The color scheme includes burgundy, amber, and purple colors as specified, with gradients applied in the hero section.

## Discrepancies Summary

1. **Hero tagline mismatch** - Expected: "Where curiosity meets connection", Found: "Building community through the art of rope bondage in Salem, Massachusetts"
2. **Multi-line title missing emphasis on "Education & Practice"** - Current title is single line: "Welcome to Witch City Rope"
3. **Navigation missing explicit Login/Sign Up links** for non-authenticated users in the header
4. **Rope SVG divider not found** between sections
5. **Features section title mismatch** - Expected: "What Makes Our Community Special", Found: "What We Offer"
6. **Footer has 3 sections instead of 4** as specified in the wireframe

## Recommendations

1. Update the hero tagline to match the wireframe specification
2. Implement a multi-line title with emphasis on "Education & Practice"
3. Add Login/Sign Up links to the main navigation for non-authenticated users
4. Implement rope SVG dividers between major sections
5. Change the features section title to "What Makes Our Community Special"
6. Reorganize the footer into 4 distinct sections

## Note on Screenshots

Due to the current environment limitations (WSL without direct browser access), a full-page screenshot could not be automatically captured. The analysis is based on the HTML content retrieved via curl. For visual verification, manual screenshots would need to be taken using:
- Browser Developer Tools (F12 > Ctrl+Shift+P > "Capture full size screenshot")
- Browser extensions like GoFullPage or Fireshot
- Or running the puppeteer script from a Windows environment with proper browser access
