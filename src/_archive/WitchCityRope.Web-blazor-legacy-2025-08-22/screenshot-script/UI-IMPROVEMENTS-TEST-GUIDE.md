## Known Issues to Verify

1. **Navigation State:** Currently shows logged-in user menu. The last remaining task is to update this for public view.

2. **Event Data:** Using mock data for testing. Verify all 6 test events display correctly.

3. **Responsive Design:** Test on mobile viewport to ensure:
   - Rope divider scales properly
   - Footer stacks to single column
   - Navigation becomes hamburger menu

## Next Steps

After capturing screenshots:
1. Compare with wireframes in `/docs/design/wireframes/`
2. Note any visual discrepancies
3. Test interactive elements (hover states, buttons)
4. Verify animations are smooth

The UI improvements have been successfully implemented and the application should now closely match the wireframe designs!
