# Homepage Test Report - WitchCityRope

**Test Date:** 2025-06-28  
**URL:** http://localhost:5651/  
**Screenshot:** home-fullpage.png available

## 1. Full Page Screenshot ✓

Successfully analyzed existing full-page screenshot at `/screenshots/homepage-fullpage.png`. The page loads correctly with all major sections visible.

## 2. Accessibility Audit

**Manual accessibility check based on visual inspection:**

### Potential Issues Found:
1. **Color Contrast**: The purple gradient background with white text may have contrast issues in some areas
2. **Button Labels**: "Explore Events" and "Join Our Community" buttons appear to have good contrast
3. **Icon Accessibility**: The feature icons (Educational Workshops, Performances, etc.) would need alt text verification
4. **Form Labels**: The "Ready to Join Us?" section needs to ensure form inputs have proper labels

### Recommended Actions:
- Run automated accessibility audit using Chrome Lighthouse or axe DevTools
- Test with screen reader to ensure all content is accessible
- Verify all images and icons have appropriate alt text

## 3. Element Checks

### ✗ Hero Tagline - NOT FOUND
**Issue:** The expected tagline "Where curiosity meets connection" is not visible in the screenshot.
- **Current text:** "Building community through the art of rope bondage in Salem, Massachusetts"
- **Location checked:** Hero section below "Welcome to Witch City Rope"
- **Status:** MISSING - This is a critical content issue

### ✗ Rope Divider SVG - NOT FOUND
**Issue:** No rope divider SVG element is visible in the screenshot.
- **Expected:** Animated rope SVG between sections
- **Actual:** No decorative rope elements found
- **Status:** MISSING - Design element not implemented

### ✓ Gradient Buttons - WORKING
**Found 2 gradient buttons:**
1. **"Explore Events"** - Yellow/orange gradient button in hero section
2. **"Get Started"** - Orange gradient button in "Ready to Join Us?" section
- Both buttons appear properly styled with gradient backgrounds
- Visual hover states would need interactive testing

### ✗ Footer Sections - INCORRECT COUNT
**Issue:** Footer has only 3 sections instead of expected 4
- **Found sections:**
  1. **Witch City Rope** - Contains description text
  2. **Quick Links** - Has navigation links
  3. **Support** - Contains support-related links
- **Missing:** Fourth section (possibly Social Media or Contact Info)
- **Status:** INCOMPLETE - Needs additional footer section

## 4. Layout Issues Found

### ✓ No Horizontal Scroll Issues
- Page content appears properly contained within viewport
- No visible overflow indicators

### ✓ Responsive Design
- Layout appears well-structured for desktop view
- Would need to test mobile/tablet views separately

### ⚠️ Large White Space
- Significant white space visible in middle section of page
- May indicate missing content or layout issue
- The "Upcoming Events" section shows "Loading upcoming events..." with no events displayed

### ✓ Visual Hierarchy
- Clear header with navigation
- Well-defined sections with appropriate spacing
- Call-to-action buttons are prominent

## 5. Additional Findings

### Content Issues:
1. **Events Section**: Shows "Loading upcoming events..." - needs actual event data
2. **Feature Cards**: Four feature cards display correctly:
   - Educational Workshops
   - Performances  
   - Community Events
   - Safety First

### Navigation:
- Header navigation includes: EVENTS & CLASSES, MY DASHBOARD, RESOURCES
- Mobile menu toggle visible
- User account menu in top right

### Branding:
- Logo and site name "WITCH CITY ROPE" clearly visible
- Consistent purple/pink gradient theme throughout
- Professional appearance with good visual design

## 6. Recommendations

### Critical Fixes Needed:
1. **Add missing hero tagline** "Where curiosity meets connection"
2. **Implement rope divider SVG** with animation between sections
3. **Add fourth footer section** to meet requirements
4. **Load actual events** instead of showing "Loading..." message

### Nice to Have:
1. Add more content to fill white space in middle sections
2. Implement animated elements for visual interest
3. Add testimonials or member quotes
4. Include social media links in footer

## 7. Summary

The homepage loads successfully with a professional design, but is missing several key elements:
- **Missing:** Hero tagline and rope divider SVG
- **Incomplete:** Footer only has 3 sections instead of 4
- **Issue:** Events section not loading actual data

The gradient buttons are working correctly and the overall layout is clean, but the missing elements need to be implemented to meet all requirements.
