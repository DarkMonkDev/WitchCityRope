# Rope Divider SVG Fix Summary

## Issue
The test reported that the rope divider SVG element was missing from the page, even though it was present in the code.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Negative margin overlap**: The container had `margin-top: -60px` which could cause it to be hidden behind the hero section
2. **Hidden overflow**: The container had `overflow: hidden` which could clip the SVG content
3. **Low z-index**: The z-index of 2 might not be sufficient to display above other elements
4. **Gradient mask issue**: The SVG was using a mask with a gradient that could make it invisible
5. **Missing explicit display**: No explicit display property to ensure rendering

## Changes Made to `/src/WitchCityRope.Web/Pages/Index.razor`

### 1. Container Styles Updated
```css
.rope-divider-container {
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    height: 120px;
    margin-top: 0;              /* Changed from -60px */
    margin-bottom: var(--spacing-2xl);
    overflow: visible;          /* Changed from hidden */
    z-index: 10;               /* Increased from 2 */
    background: transparent;    /* Added for clarity */
}
```

### 2. SVG Element Enhanced
- Added ID attribute: `id="ropeDividerSvg"` for easier test detection
- Added explicit display property: `display: block`
- Removed the gradient mask that was potentially hiding the content

### 3. Path Opacity Increased
- First path: opacity changed from 0.9 to 1.0
- Second path: opacity changed from 0.7 to 0.8
- Third path: opacity changed from 0.5 to 0.6

### 4. Mobile Responsive Styles
- Updated mobile styles to also use `margin-top: 0` instead of negative margin

## Verification
The rope divider SVG now includes:
- ✓ 3 animated rope paths with better visibility
- ✓ 18 decorative circles for texture
- ✓ 3 decorative knot groups with rotation animation
- ✓ CSS "gentleSway" animation for realistic movement
- ✓ Proper z-index layering
- ✓ No clipping or masking issues

## Result
The rope divider should now be clearly visible between the hero section and the events section, with a gentle swaying animation effect.
