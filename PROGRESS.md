## Development Standards

### Web+API Microservices Architecture
- **Web Service** (React + Vite): UI/Auth at http://localhost:5173
- **API Service** (Minimal API): Business logic at http://localhost:5653  
- **Database** (PostgreSQL): localhost:5433
- **Pattern**: React → HTTP → API → Database (NEVER React → Database directly)

### Authentication Pattern - FINAL DECISION (August 16, 2025)
- ✅ **HYBRID JWT + HttpOnly Cookies** with ASP.NET Core Identity
- ✅ **Rationale**: Service-to-service authentication requirement discovered during vertical slice testing
- ✅ **Pattern**: React (Cookies) → Web Service → JWT → API Service
- ✅ **Cost**: $0 - completely free solution
- ✅ **Reference**: `/docs/functional-areas/vertical-slice-home-page/authentication-decision-report.md`
- ❌ **NEVER** store auth tokens in localStorage (XSS risk)
- ✅ **Use** React Context for auth state management

### React Development Standards
- ✅ `.tsx` files for React components
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ✅ React Router for navigation
- ✅ Strict component prop typing
- ❌ Class components (use functional components)
- ❌ Direct DOM manipulation (use React refs when needed)
- ❌ Inline event handlers for complex logic

### Testing Standards
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright ONLY (location: `/tests/playwright/`)
- **React Tests**: Vitest + Testing Library
- **API Tests**: .NET test projects
- **Run Commands**: `npm run test:e2e:playwright`

## Next Steps

### ✅ COMPLETED: Vertical Slice Implementation
**Goal**: Implement a minimal home page that displays events from the API (Technical Proof-of-Concept)

**Final Status**: ✅ **ALL 5 PHASES COMPLETE - WORKFLOW VALIDATED**  
**Completion Summary**: Full 5-phase workflow orchestration proven successful with quality gates exceeding targets

**Revised Scope**:
- **Step 1**: Hardcoded API response (prove React ↔ API communication)
- **Step 2**: Database integration (prove API ↔ Database communication)  
- **Primary Goal**: Validate technology stack communication
- **Secondary Goal**: Test 5-phase workflow with sub-agents
- **Key Deliverable**: Lessons learned documentation

**Major Simplifications Applied**:
- Removed all production concerns (SEO, performance, security hardening)
- No authentication or business logic
- Progressive testing approach (hardcoded → database)
- Explicit throwaway code expectation
- Focus purely on technical validation

**Working Folder**: `/docs/functional-areas/vertical-slice-home-page/`

**Complete Workflow Achievements (BOTH VERTICAL SLICES)**:

**Events Vertical Slice**:
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Requirements (96% quality gate) - Business analysis and technical specifications
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Design (92% quality gate) - UI mockups, API design, database schema
- ✅ **Phase 3**: Implementation (85% quality gate) - Full stack working (React ↔ API ↔ PostgreSQL)
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Testing (100% quality gate) - All tests passing, lint validation complete
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Finalization (100% quality gate) - Code formatted, documentation complete

- ✅ **Phase 4**: Testing (100% quality gate) - Security validation, flow testing, performance verification
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Finalization (100% quality gate) - Production-ready security patterns documented, formatted code, complete documentation

**Overall Achievements**:

- ✅ **Technical Stack Validation**: React + TypeScript + .NET API + PostgreSQL + ASP.NET Core Identity proven
- ✅ **Process Validation**: 5-phase workflow executed TWICE successfully with consistent quality
- ✅ **Authentication Architecture DISCOVERED**: Service-to-service requirements changed original NextAuth.js plan
- ✅ **Cost Optimization ACHIEVED**: $0 implementation vs $550+/month commercial alternatives
- ✅ **Security Standards VALIDATED**: XSS/CSRF protection, proper session management, JWT service auth

### Next Phase: Docker Implementation of Authentication Pattern

**Immediate Next Task**: Implement the SAME authentication vertical slice in Docker containers

**Goal**: Validate that the proven authentication pattern works identically in containerized environment
- Docker Compose configuration for React + API + PostgreSQL
- Service-to-service authentication between containers
- Container networking and environment configuration
- All test pages and validation scripts working in containerized environment

**Working Foundation**: Authentication is 100% complete and working in development environment
- React app on localhost:5173 with complete auth flows
- API on localhost:5655 with JWT + Cookie pattern
- All test endpoints and validation pages operational
- Test user: testuser@example.com / Test1234

### Next Phase: Scale Workflow to Full Migration

**Immediate Priorities** (Based on PROVEN Workflow - 2 Successful Vertical Slices):
1. **User Management**: Apply validated 5-phase process to user CRUD operations
2. **Content Management**: Migrate content editing with proven sub-agent coordination
3. **Event Management**: Expand event system with full CRUD capabilities
4. **Role-Based Access**: Implement full permission system using validated auth patterns

**How to Continue Development**:
1. Start Claude Code in project directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react
   claude-code .
   ```

2. Use proven orchestration pattern for next feature:
   ```
   /orchestrate Implement user authentication feature. Follow the validated 5-phase workflow with the same sub-agent coordination that was successful in the vertical slice. Enforce all quality gates and maintain documentation standards.
   ```

### ✅ VALIDATED Workflow Process
- **Phase 1**: Requirements (96% quality gate achieved - with human review)
- **Phase 2**: Design (92% quality gate achieved - multi-agent coordination)  
- **Phase 3**: Implementation (85% quality gate achieved - full stack working)
- **Phase 4**: Testing (100% quality gate achieved - comprehensive validation)
- **Phase 5**: Finalization (100% quality gate achieved - code formatting & documentation)

**Key Success Factors Validated**:
- Sub-agent specialization with clear boundaries
- Quality gate enforcement at every phase
- Human review checkpoints with explicit approval criteria
- Progressive implementation strategy (hardcoded → database)
- Complete documentation and lessons learned capture

## File Management Standards

### ALL File Operations MUST Be Logged
**Location**: `/docs/architecture/file-registry.md`

**Required for EVERY file operation**:
```markdown
| Date | File Path | Action | Purpose | Session/Task | Status | Cleanup Date |
```

### File Location Rules
- ❌ **NEVER** create files in the root directory
- ✅ **USE** `/session-work/YYYY-MM-DD/` for temporary files
- ✅ **NAME** files descriptively with dates
- ✅ **REVIEW** and clean up files at session end

### Critical Prevention Rules
- ❌ `/docs/docs/` folders (THIS IS CRITICAL - happened before!)
- ❌ Files in root directory (except README, PROGRESS, ARCHITECTURE, CLAUDE)
- ❌ Duplicate documentation
- ❌ Inconsistent naming
