<!-- This is the authoritative progress document - all other status reports have been archived -->

## Project Overview
WitchCityRope is a Blazor Server application for a rope bondage community in Salem, offering workshops, and social events. The project uses a Web+API microservices architecture with PostgreSQL database, with the entire system deployed in docker containers.

3. **E2E Test Migration**: All 180 Puppeteer tests migrated to Playwright
4. **Form Component Standardization**: 100% forms use WCR validation components
5. **Docker Development Tools**: Created dev.sh and restart-web.sh for hot reload issues

### ü§ñ AI Workflow Orchestration (August 12, 2025)
1. **Orchestration System Implemented**: Complete AI workflow with quality gates and human reviews
2. **11 Specialized Sub-Agents Created**: Each focused on specific development tasks
3. **Phased Development Workflow**: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Testing ‚Üí Finalization
4. **Quality Gates Configured**: Flexible thresholds by work type (Feature/Bug/Hotfix/Docs/Refactor)
5. **Document Organization**: Consolidated user management and membership-vetting documentation

## Technical Debt & Issues

### High Priority
1. **Hot Reload Issues**: Blazor Server hot reload fails frequently
2. **Test Consolidation**: Multiple test projects need merging
3. **Navigation Fix**: User dropdown menu doesn't close properly

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance**: Event listing page needs optimization
2. **Caching**: Implement distributed caching
3. **Monitoring**: Add application insights

### Low Priority
1. **UI Polish**: Consistent styling across all pages
2. **Documentation**: API documentation needs updating
3. **Code Cleanup**: Remove deprecated code

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Rules
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Use Blazor Server (no WebAssembly)
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS: PostgreSQL (no SQL Server)
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Syncfusion components (no MudBlazor)
- ‚ùå NEVER: Create .cshtml files (only .razor)
- ‚ùå NEVER: Use MediatR (direct service injection)

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: Minimum 80% coverage
- Integration tests: All API endpoints
- E2E tests: Critical user journeys
- Use Playwright for E2E (not Puppeteer)

## Session History

### August 12, 2025 - AI Workflow Orchestration Implementation

#### Overview
Implemented a comprehensive AI workflow orchestration system with specialized sub-agents for automated software development lifecycle management.

#### Accomplishments
1. **Designed Orchestration System**
   - Created formalized workflow with 5 phases and quality gates
   - Designed flexible quality thresholds by work type
   - Implemented mandatory human review points

2. **Created 11 Specialized Sub-Agents**

   - Document-based agent communication
   - Progress tracking in multiple locations
   - Improvement suggestion collection

4. **Fixed Critical Issues**
   - Resolved folder creation problems
   - Enhanced human review gate enforcement
   - Improved agent delegation instructions

5. **Documentation Consolidation**
   - Merged membership-vetting into user-management
   - Created proper business requirements
   - Organized wireframes and specifications

#### Technical Changes
