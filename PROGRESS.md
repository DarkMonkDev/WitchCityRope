# WitchCityRope Development Progress
<!-- Last Updated: 2025-08-04 -->
<!-- This is the authoritative progress document - all other status reports have been archived -->

## Project Overview
WitchCityRope is a Blazor Server application for a rope bondage community in Salem, offering workshops, performances, and social events. The project uses a Web+API microservices architecture with PostgreSQL database.

## Current Status Summary

### 🏗️ Architecture
- **Pattern**: Web+API microservices (Web→API→Database)
- **Web Service**: Blazor Server UI at port 5651
- **API Service**: Minimal API at port 5653
- **Database**: PostgreSQL at port 5433
- **Authentication**: ASP.NET Core Identity with cookie auth (Web) and JWT (API)
- **UI Framework**: Syncfusion Blazor Components (subscription active)

### 📊 Build & Test Status (as of January 2025)
- **Build Status**: ✅ Solution builds successfully with 0 errors
- **Core Tests**: ✅ 99.5% passing (202/203 tests)
- **API Tests**: ✅ 95% passing (117/123 tests)
- **Integration Tests**: 🟡 86% passing (115/133 tests)
- **E2E Tests**: ✅ Migrated to Playwright, 83% passing
- **Web Tests**: 🔴 Multiple projects need consolidation

### 🚀 Recent Achievements (January 2025)
1. **Pure Blazor Server Migration**: Successfully converted from hybrid Razor Pages to pure Blazor
2. **Authentication Pattern Fix**: Implemented proper API endpoint pattern for Blazor Server auth
3. **E2E Test Migration**: All 180 Puppeteer tests migrated to Playwright
4. **Form Component Standardization**: 100% forms use WCR validation components
5. **Docker Development Tools**: Created dev.sh and restart-web.sh for hot reload issues

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### 🔴 Critical Issues
1. **Admin Role Assignment**: Manual database update required after registration
2. **Hot Reload**: Docker hot reload unreliable, requires container restart
3. **Test Project Consolidation**: 3 separate Web test projects need merging

### 🟡 Medium Priority Issues
1. **Integration Test Flakiness**: Concurrency issues in database tests
2. **Performance Tests**: All failing, need infrastructure update
3. **Email Service**: Mock implementation, needs real SMTP
4. **File Uploads**: No implementation for event images

### 🟢 Low Priority Issues
1. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Some admin pages need optimization
2. **Accessibility**: Need comprehensive WCAG audit
3. **Internationalization**: No i18n support
4. **API Versioning**: Not implemented

## Development Guidelines

### 🚨 Critical Rules
1. **NEVER** create Razor Pages - pure Blazor Server only
2. **NEVER** use SignInManager in Blazor components - use API endpoints
3. **NEVER** add MudBlazor or other UI frameworks - Syncfusion only
4. **ALWAYS** use development Docker build, not production
5. **ALWAYS** use Playwright for E2E tests, not Puppeteer
