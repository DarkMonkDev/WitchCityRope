## Development Standards

### Web+API Microservices Architecture
- **Web Service** (React + Vite): UI/Auth at http://localhost:5173
- **API Service** (Minimal API): Business logic at http://localhost:5653  
- **Database** (PostgreSQL): localhost:5433
- **Pattern**: React → HTTP → API → Database (NEVER React → Database directly)

### Authentication Pattern - FINAL DECISION (August 16, 2025)
- ✅ **HYBRID JWT + HttpOnly Cookies** with ASP.NET Core Identity
- ✅ **Rationale**: Service-to-service authentication requirement discovered during vertical slice testing
- ✅ **Pattern**: React (Cookies) → Web Service → JWT → API Service
- ✅ **Cost**: $0 - completely free solution
- ✅ **Reference**: `/docs/functional-areas/vertical-slice-home-page/authentication-decision-report.md`
- ❌ **NEVER** store auth tokens in localStorage (XSS risk)
- ✅ **Use** React Context for auth state management

### React Development Standards
- ✅ `.tsx` files for React components
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ✅ React Router for navigation
- ✅ Strict component prop typing
- ❌ Class components (use functional components)
- ❌ Direct DOM manipulation (use React refs when needed)
- ❌ Inline event handlers for complex logic

### Testing Standards
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright ONLY (location: `/tests/playwright/`)
- **React Tests**: Vitest + Testing Library
- **API Tests**: .NET test projects
- **Run Commands**: `npm run test:e2e:playwright`
