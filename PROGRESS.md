## Technical Debt & Issues

### High Priority
1. **Hot Reload Issues**: Blazor Server hot reload fails frequently
2. **Test Consolidation**: Multiple test projects need merging
3. **Navigation Fix**: User dropdown menu doesn't close properly

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance**: Event listing page needs optimization
2. **Caching**: Implement distributed caching
3. **Monitoring**: Add application insights

### Low Priority
1. **UI Polish**: Consistent styling across all pages
2. **Documentation**: API documentation needs updating
3. **Code Cleanup**: Remove deprecated code

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Rules
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Use Blazor Server (no WebAssembly)
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS: PostgreSQL (no SQL Server)
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Syncfusion components (no MudBlazor)
- ‚ùå NEVER: Create .cshtml files (only .razor)
- ‚ùå NEVER: Use MediatR (direct service injection)

### AI Workflow Rules
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Let orchestrator handle complex development tasks
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Use human review points for requirements and vertical slices
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS: Follow phased development approach
- ‚ùå NEVER: Skip quality gates without explicit approval

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests: Minimum 80% coverage
- Integration tests: All API endpoints
- E2E tests: Critical user journeys
- Use Playwright for E2E (not Puppeteer)

## Session Handoff Instructions

### FOR THE NEXT SESSION:

#### Immediate Actions:
1. **Verify AI Orchestration**: Confirm all agents are loaded and operational
2. **Continue User Management**: Simply state "Continue implementing the user management feature" - orchestrator will handle the rest
3. **Follow Review Points**: Orchestrator will pause at mandatory human review gates

#### What's Ready:
- ‚úÖ Feature branch created and current: `feature/2025-08-12-user-management-redesign`
- ‚úÖ All requirements and design documentation complete
- ‚úÖ Vertical slice (AdminNotesPanel) implemented and tested
- ‚úÖ AI orchestration system fully operational
- ‚úÖ All agent configurations include lessons-learned integration

#### Expected Flow:
1. New session requests user management continuation
2. Orchestrator automatically invokes with proper context
3. Orchestrator reviews existing work and continues implementation
4. Human review after next vertical slice completion
5. Full feature completion with testing and validation
