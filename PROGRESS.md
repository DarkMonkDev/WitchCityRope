- ✅ **Reference**: `/docs/functional-areas/vertical-slice-home-page/authentication-decision-report.md`
- ❌ **NEVER** store auth tokens in localStorage (XSS risk)
- ✅ **Use** React Context for auth state management

### React Development Standards
- ✅ `.tsx` files for React components
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Functional components with hooks
- ✅ React Router for navigation
