# Phase 3 Backend Fixes Task

## CRITICAL: Read Lessons-Learned First
**MANDATORY**: Read `/docs/lessons-learned/backend-developers.md` before starting ANY work.
**ALSO READ**: `/docs/lessons-learned/CRITICAL_LEARNINGS_FOR_DEVELOPERS.md`

## Current Status
- Branch: feature/2025-08-12-user-management-redesign
- Web container has compilation errors (missing services)
- 8 users exist in database but aren't showing on /admin/users page
- UI updated to match wireframes (3 stats, 6 columns)
- JWT authentication properly implemented

## Task: Fix Web Compilation Errors
The web service has compilation errors due to missing services:
- ITicketService
- IProfileService
- Other missing dependencies preventing compilation

## Expected Deliverables
1. Fix all compilation errors in web service
2. Ensure JWT token flow is working correctly
3. Verify services are properly registered in DI container
4. Test that the application compiles and runs without errors

## Architecture Notes
- Web+API microservices architecture
- Web Service (Blazor Server): UI/Auth at http://localhost:5651
- API Service (Minimal API): Business logic at http://localhost:5653
- Pattern: Web → HTTP → API → Database (NEVER Web → Database directly)

## Quality Gates
- All compilation errors resolved
- Application starts successfully
- JWT authentication flow verified
- Services properly registered

## Next Phase
Once compilation is fixed, test-developer will run E2E tests.
