## MANDATORY STARTUP PROCEDURE
**BEFORE starting ANY work, you MUST:**
1. **Read Your Lessons Learned** (MANDATORY)
   - Location: `/docs/lessons-learned/ui-designer-lessons-learned.md`
   - This file contains critical knowledge specific to your role
   - Apply these lessons to all work
2. Read `/docs/lessons-learned/CRITICAL_LEARNINGS_FOR_DEVELOPERS.md` for critical architectural issues
3. Read `/docs/standards-processes/form-fields-and-validation-standards.md` - Form design standards
4. Read `/docs/standards-processes/validation-standardization/` - Validation patterns
5. Read `/docs/standards-processes/development-standards/react-patterns.md` - React patterns
6. Remember: This is a React SPA - Use functional components with hooks

## MANDATORY STANDARDS MAINTENANCE
**You MUST maintain:**
1. Update `/docs/standards-processes/form-fields-and-validation-standards.md` for new patterns
2. Keep validation library current in `/docs/standards-processes/validation-standardization/`

## Lessons Learned Maintenance

You MUST maintain your lessons learned file:
- **Add new lessons**: Document any significant discoveries or solutions
- **Remove outdated lessons**: Delete entries that no longer apply due to migration or technology changes
- **Keep it actionable**: Every lesson should have clear action items
- **Update regularly**: Don't wait until end of session - update as you learn

## MANDATORY LESSON CONTRIBUTION
**When you discover new patterns, issues, or solutions:**
1. Document them immediately in `/docs/lessons-learned/ui-designer-lessons-learned.md`
2. If critical for all developers, add to `/docs/lessons-learned/CRITICAL_LEARNINGS_FOR_DEVELOPERS.md`
3. Use the established format: Problem → Solution → Example

## Chakra UI Components Used

| Component | Purpose | Configuration |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Table | Data display | Sorting, filtering, pagination |
| Button | Actions | Variant, size, colorScheme |

- React Hook Form integration

### Loading States
- Chakra UI Spinner during data fetch
- Skeleton components for content
- Progress component for multi-step
- Framer Motion loading animations

### Feedback

- Framer Motion success animations
- Alert components for errors with recovery options

## Responsive Breakpoints

- Tablet (md): 768px - 1023px  
- Desktop (lg): 1024px - 1439px
- Large (xl): 1440px+

```

### Visual Mockup React
Save to: `/docs/functional-areas/[feature]/new-work/[date]/design/mockup.jsx`

Create working React component mockup using Chakra UI and Tailwind CSS.

## React Component Guidelines

### Common Chakra UI Components
- **Table**: For all data tables with sorting/filtering
- **Button**: Primary/secondary actions with variants
- **Input/FormControl**: Text inputs with validation
- **Select**: Dropdowns and selects
- **DatePicker**: Date selections (react-datepicker integration)
- **Modal**: Modal dialogs with overlay
- **Toast**: Notifications with positioning
- **Spinner/Skeleton**: Loading indicators
- **Tabs**: Tabbed interfaces
- **Drawer**: Mobile navigation and sidebars

### Styling Approach
```jsx
// Chakra UI theme extension
const theme = extendTheme({
  colors: {
    brand: {
      50: '#f3f0ff',
      500: '#6B46C1', // Purple
      900: '#1A1A2E', // Dark blue
    },
    gray: {
      50: '#f7fafc',
      900: '#0F0F1E', // Background
    }
  },
  config: {
    initialColorMode: 'dark',
    useSystemColorMode: false,
  }
})

// Tailwind utilities for custom styling
<Box className="bg-gradient-to-r from-purple-900 to-indigo-900">
  <Button colorScheme="brand" size="lg">
    Action Button
  </Button>
</Box>
```

## Mobile-First Considerations
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Framer Motion swipe gestures for navigation
- Chakra UI Collapse for collapsible sections
- Drawer component for bottom sheet patterns
- Thumb-zone optimization with sticky positioning
- CSS Grid and Flexbox for responsive layouts
- Tailwind responsive utilities (sm:, md:, lg:, xl:)

## Community-Specific Patterns

### Event Displays
- Clear capacity indicators
- Sliding scale pricing visible
- Teacher photos and bios
- Safety requirements prominent

### Vetting Process
- Step progress indicators
- Clear requirements
- Upload areas for documents
- Status tracking visible

### Privacy Controls
- Visibility toggles
- Anonymous options
- Data sharing preferences
- Profile privacy levels
