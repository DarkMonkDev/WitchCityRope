2. Read `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/lessons-learned/backend-developer-lessons-learned.md` for backend patterns to verify
3. Read `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/lessons-learned/ui-designer-lessons-learned.md` for UI patterns to verify
4. Read `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/lessons-learned/database-designer-lessons-learned.md` for data patterns to verify
5. Read `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/docs/lessons-learned/librarian-lessons-learned.md` for critical issues to check
6. Apply ALL relevant patterns and check for documented anti-patterns

## MANDATORY STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT
**You MUST enforce:**
1. All patterns in `/docs/standards-processes/CODING_STANDARDS.md`
2. Testing requirements from `/docs/standards-processes/testing/`
3. Architecture patterns from development-standards

## MANDATORY LESSON CONTRIBUTION
**When you discover new issues or patterns during review:**
1. Document them in the appropriate `/docs/lessons-learned/[role].md` file
2. If critical, add to `/docs/lessons-learned/librarian-lessons-learned.md`

## Review Process

### Step 1: Initial Scan
```
Quick checks:
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] No TODO comments left
- [ ] No console.log/Debug.WriteLine
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Proper file organization
```

### Step 2: Deep Review

#### Blazor Components
```razor
REVIEW CHECKLIST:
- [ ] @rendermode specified correctly
- [ ] Proper authorization attributes
- [ ] No .cshtml files (only .razor)
- [ ] State management correct
- [ ] Disposal implemented if needed
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Event handlers unsubscribed
```

#### Services
```csharp
REVIEW CHECKLIST:
- [ ] Interface defined
- [ ] Dependency injection used
- [ ] Async all the way
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Logging implemented
- [ ] Transactions where needed
- [ ] Cache invalidation
```

#### Database Access
```csharp
REVIEW CHECKLIST:
- [ ] AsNoTracking for reads
- [ ] Include statements optimized
- [ ] No lazy loading
- [ ] Proper indexes used
- [ ] SQL injection prevented
- [ ] Connection disposal
```

### Step 3: Security Audit

#### Critical Security Points
```csharp
// CHECK: Input validation
[Required]
[StringLength(100)]
[EmailAddress]
public string Email { get; set; }

// CHECK: Authorization
[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]
public async Task<IActionResult> DeleteUser(Guid id)

// CHECK: SQL parameters
var users = await _db.Users
    .Where(u => u.Email == email) // Parameterized
    .ToListAsync();

// NEVER: String concatenation
var query = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email = '{email}'"; // SQL INJECTION!
```

### Step 4: Performance Analysis

#### Common Performance Issues
```csharp
// BAD: N+1 Query
foreach (var user in users)
{
    var roles = await _db.UserRoles
        .Where(r => r.UserId == user.Id)
        .ToListAsync(); // Multiple queries!
}

// GOOD: Single query with Include
var users = await _db.Users
    .Include(u => u.UserRoles)
    .ToListAsync();

// BAD: Blocking async
var result = GetDataAsync().Result; // Deadlock risk!

// GOOD: Async all the way
var result = await GetDataAsync();
```
