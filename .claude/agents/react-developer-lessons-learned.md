# React Developer - Lessons Learned

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL TESTING RULES - NEVER VIOLATE ðŸš¨

### BROWSER TESTING - PLAYWRIGHT ONLY
- **ALWAYS USE PLAYWRIGHT** for browser-based testing and debugging
- **NEVER INSTALL PUPPETEER** - This is a HARD VIOLATION
- **NEVER INSTALL ANY TESTING PACKAGES** without explicit user permission
- Playwright is already installed and configured - USE IT
- Location: `/tests/playwright/`
- Run tests: `npm run test:e2e:playwright`

### PACKAGE INSTALLATION RULES
- **DO NOT INSTALL NEW PACKAGES** without explicit permission
- **ESPECIALLY NO TESTING PACKAGES** - We have everything we need
- If you think you need a package, ASK FIRST
- The following are BANNED:
  - puppeteer
  - cypress  
  - selenium
  - Any alternative testing frameworks

### DEBUGGING REACT COMPONENTS
When debugging React components:
1. Use Playwright for browser automation: `npx playwright test`
2. Use the existing test infrastructure in `/tests/playwright/`
3. Create temporary test files if needed but use Playwright
4. Check browser console with Playwright's page.evaluate()
5. Take screenshots with Playwright for visual debugging

## WORKTREE COMPLIANCE - MANDATORY

### YOU MUST WORK IN THE CORRECT DIRECTORY
- **ALWAYS** check current directory with `pwd` first
- **REQUIRED**: Work in `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/.worktrees/feature-2025-08-24-events-management/`
- **NEVER** work in the main repository at `/home/chad/repos/witchcityrope-react/`
- **VERIFY** all file paths include `.worktrees/feature-2025-08-24-events-management/`

### File Organization Rules
- React components go in `apps/web/src/components/`
- Pages go in `apps/web/src/pages/`
- Types go in `apps/web/src/types/`
- Tests go in `tests/playwright/`

## Technology Stack
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Mantine v7 UI components (NOT v8)
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- React Router v6 for routing
- Playwright for E2E testing (NO OTHER TESTING TOOLS)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Package Imports
- Check if package exists in package.json FIRST
- DO NOT auto-install missing packages
- Create local type definitions if shared types are missing
- Ask for permission before ANY npm install

### Component Not Rendering
1. Check browser console with Playwright
2. Verify all imports are correct
3. Check for missing dependencies in package.json
4. Use Playwright to debug rendering issues
5. NEVER install puppeteer to debug

### Testing Approach
```typescript
// CORRECT - Using Playwright
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('component renders', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:5174/demo');
  await expect(page.locator('.component')).toBeVisible();
});

// WRONG - NEVER DO THIS
// import puppeteer from 'puppeteer'; // BANNED
```

## Architecture Patterns
- Functional components with hooks (no class components)
- Proper TypeScript typing for all props
- Use existing Mantine components (v7)
- Follow vertical slice architecture

## Remember
- **PLAYWRIGHT ONLY** for browser testing
- **NO NEW TESTING PACKAGES** without permission
- **ALWAYS WORK IN WORKTREE** directory
- **ASK BEFORE INSTALLING** any packages
