## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### Start the WitchCityRope Application
```bash
cd /home/chad/repos/witchcityrope/WitchCityRope
~/.dotnet/dotnet run --project src/WitchCityRope.Web
```

### Database Operations
```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL
sudo -u postgres psql

# Create WitchCityRope database
sudo -u postgres createdb witchcityrope_db
```

### Docker Operations
```bash
# Note: Log out and back in for docker group to take effect
# Then you can run docker without sudo
docker ps
docker run hello-world
```

### Browser Automation
```bash
# Browser-tools (low-level automation)
/home/chad/mcp-servers/browser-tools-server/start-server.sh

# Stagehand (AI-powered automation) 
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
/home/chad/mcp-servers/mcp-server-browserbase/stagehand/quickstart.sh
```

### GitHub Operations
```bash
gh repo view DarkMonkDev/WitchCityRope
gh issue list
gh pr list
```

## üìù Important Notes

1. **Docker Group**: You need to log out and log back in for the docker group membership to take effect. After that, you can run docker commands without sudo.

2. **PostgreSQL**: The service is running with default settings. You'll need to:
   - Create the witchcityrope_db database
   - Set up the user with password as specified in CLAUDE.md

3. **Browser Automation**: Unlike WSL, both MCP servers are now properly configured for native Ubuntu with direct Chrome access - no SSH tunnels or workarounds needed!

4. **.NET SDK**: The project requires .NET 9.0 which is installed at `~/.dotnet`. Make sure to use `~/.dotnet/dotnet` or add it to your PATH permanently.

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Create the PostgreSQL database for the project
2. Run database migrations
3. Start the application
4. Test the UI automation tools with the running application

All tools are installed, configured, and tested. The environment is ready for development! üöÄ
